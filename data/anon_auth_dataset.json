The more likely truth is more boring and people don't like it.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  I've seen NO proof.

If they were it\u2019d be Osama and not Zarqawi.  When was the last time the Bush Administration said \u201call we have to do is kill Zarqawi and it\u2019s over\u201d.  Most of the media I see hardly mentions Zarqawi anymore except in saying he is the likely leader of al qaeda in Iraq.  Which from the best info we have he is.

Hope for 5% appreciation to cover 5% RE commission.\r\n\r\nBy my calculation, $7500/yr in rent is equivalent to owning $100000 of home, if you presume no home appreciation.  This is approximately the comparative rent levels in my area.\r\n\r\nIf instead of presuming 6% aftertax investment return, you presume just 4% higher investment returns than home appreciation (after RE commmission) which is actually the historical rates, then $5500/yr ~$460/mo per $100,000 home value.\r\n\r\nSo it boils down to expected returns from alternative investments, deducting 1.5% from home ownership.\r\n\r\nYou can get 5% from US government bonds.\r\nIf you think there is a housing bubble, don't buy.

We were paying about $600 a month after downpayment. The downpayment was about 20K$. So...\r\n\r\nI was deferring the interest on 20K$ - this amounted to about $175 a month at the time.\r\n\r\nI was paying about $75 in fees and maintenance a month.\r\n\r\nSo let's say I was out $600+$75+$175 = $850.\r\n\r\nRent for a similar place - an IDENTICAL unit in the SAME complex - at the time was $8-900. In other words, I paid exactly NO surcharge for buying that place. And I accumulated ownership which I wouldn't have otherwise. We opted to pay double payments some months because at the time the rate on the mortgage wasn't great and so... by the time we sold it we had mostly paid it off.\r\n\r\nThen we sold it and lost 4%. That 4% was a hell of a lot less than the amount we had paid forward even only counting the single payments.\r\n\r\nIn our second house (the current one) we opted for 50% higher payments on a short (20yr) mortgage. We paid it off in 9 years. Now it was a $160K CDN house, which where I live is very nice but not a castle by any means. But like other posters here we made due with an old car and so on. But I got to thinking 'what if I had RENTED this place instead.' Now it is hard to tell because it is a unique house in a neighborhood but a little digging revealed that my rent would have been almost exactly our higher payments (because the rental market on nice houses is not very friendly...) so, again, we would have made no real progress on equity while paying the same amount.\r\n\r\nSo... while you can't generalize from specifics in some cases, at least for me his arguments are bogus. They only work if you ignore the amount you pay on rent, which for a nice house is a fairly hefty amount over a conservative mortgage.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents investment in a 20 year mortgage :&lt;)\r\n", "Which is why, where I teach, there is a rule that you don't shut the door when a student is in your office, EVER.

I apologize for that.\r\n\r\nOn to the actual arguments. \r\n\r\nFirst, I take the point that you have to mention that I made a spelling mistake to be of the same nature as my calling you a bonehead. You need to add insults to bolster your arguments. \r\n\r\n\"I took issue with the title of your post\". I'm sorry, I didn't post anything, so I didn't title the post, so I wasn't U.S. bashing. Somebody called 'Godspiral' wrote the post. And if you read my post carefully (which you mostly did, with some very valid criticisms I'd agree) you'd see that I never bashed the US. I bashed Canadian doctors and nurses who run with their free education to the US. I think it speaks very highly of the US to come and recruit here - they get good doctors and nurses who come from a good training environment. If you can see US bashing in here please point it out to me, because I can't.\r\n\r\nMy point was and is that Canada, by providing these people, is in effect subsidising the US system, whereas I don't see that the difference in drug prices between the US and Canada is a direct taxpayer subsidy. The drug companies take advantage of you more than me. On the other hand, my taxes DIRECTLY train those doctors and nurses, because we have a state-run health and health-training system. \r\n\r\nIf you believe that the fact that your drug prices are higher is a subsidy, then I would counter (and I DON'T believe this, I'm just extending your argument and asking for clarification) then the fact that in Canada U.S. books are 35-40% more expensive than they are in the U.S., whereas the difference in currency value has been less than 20% for years, means that we're subsidizing your books. You could make similar arguments about cars, but that is a more complex issue because there are actual subsidies involved.\r\n\r\nNext, I don't see how the U.S. taxpayer is indirectly or directly subsidizing the pharma's more than Canada is. I'm not saying it isn't true, it just isn't obvious from drug prices. A country could, in principle, hugely subsidize research and in return get lower prices as a 'thank you'. Not that this is likely. But it is possible. How do you know what subsidies Canada has for research? In fact, if you look at the numbers for science as a whole (don't know the health care numbers), Canada does a really 2nd rate job of funding science. But this isn't obvious from the argument you make, which seems to be that subsidies are somehow proportional to... drug prices at stores... or something?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why it is a minor point that Canada subsidizes your staffing. 'on the whole it is most likely wrong' =&gt; well, if it is wrong, please say how. And no, not a barometer of my intelligence and status. But of my access to the data. I don't make comments about, say, trucking or chip design or the theory of computation because I don't have any knowledge of that. \r\n\r\nNow... As I said, I didn't post the article. I didn't bash your country. I don't think you are stupid for not using our system. Our system, if you had bothered to say look into it a bit, is falling apart under its own weight. It is doomed. I'd like to hope we end up with some measure of a system with social equity, but having a system where people can go to the doctor every week and use up valuable resources, thereby not leaving any money for, say, tests or some forms of treatment, is not supportable. So... I didn't make or infer any of the things you said I did.\r\n\r\nHowever. I still don't see any evidence whatsoever you paid half of my 'tax bill.' You keep asserting this. I hinted that I have reason to know that we have a doctor and nurse drain to the U.S. as a way of saying that this is a credible statement. If you want me to take your repeated statements about you subsidizing us as reasonable you need to either list the facts or at least hint that you are in a position (say, it is your job to analyze this stuff?????) to know.\r\n\r\nNo, I'd never fool myself into thinking that Canada has the perfect solution, nor did I say so.

Waving a camera in some people's faces is not a large poll.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the average Iraqi does resent the current situation. I can understand why they would, given the number of causualties.

Double that for a non-specialist doctor. Add another $100,000 per specialty.\r\n\r\nWe lose more than a THIRD of our doctors to the US market. In other words, we subsidize your economy by providing very very expensive free training.\r\n\r\nWhy do they go to the US? Because in an open market you make more money. How convenient that AFTER they get their PAID education (we PAY them to go to school in many cases - scholarships and assistantships) they suddenly become all free-market on us. \r\n\r\nI personally think these people are hypocrits and should have to pay back their education - to the amount they would have paid at a major US school - if they don't practice in Canada for a few years. \r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of all that ranting, we provide your system with free educated professionals.

However, having 'everyone gets a vote' won't work either. Just look at how Walmart has managed to subvert Wikipedia's commentary about... Walmart.\r\n\r\nAs for the outright lies.\r\n\r\nThe article says that people who referee papers are amateurs with no accountability. Horseshit. I've been a professional academic for (depending on whether you count grad work or not) between a decade and 20 years. I am a referree, quite regularly, and on grants committee's. The whole process is very involved but essentially at every point you have to point out conflict of interest and leave the room for decisions that are either of benefit to you or relate to direct competitors (within reason). \r\n\r\nYes, there are biases. The process is biased towards the status quo. But zero accountability? No way. If you give off-the-cuff reviews then the metareviewers remove you from the pool. Sure, you can find exceptions to this- superpowerful big name researchers for example - but for the most part the process is watchers-who-watch and quite fair. I have been the 'metareviewer' (usually called a third opinion, because most papers are reviewed by two people) a number of times and it is not fun, because you are both reviewing the paper and implicitly reviewing the reviewers (the editor wouldn't call you in if there wasn't a big discrepancy between reviews).\r\n\r\nIn my experience most papers are crap in some way. Badly written, shoddy background research / literature review, crappy experimental method, over the top 'consequences' and so on. Many are essentially undergraduate or MSc research projects that taught the student a lot but shouldn't inflate the already crazy amount of published material. And of course, people who get rejections get annoyed.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear hierarchy of journals - in the sciences, 'Science' and 'Nature' are at the top. Some people will fire a paper higher than it deserves and resubmit down the chain until it ends up in some mediocre journal somewhere. Some people flame the reviewers and have a tantrum. Some people improve their writing and research and stop submitting half-assed stuff and eventually start getting published.\r\n\r\nIMHO the big problem is that academics are expected to publish an 'above-average' number of papers. Can you say runaway inflation? I'd say the average academic can manage one credible first-authored paper a year (yes, there are exceptions in fields where you can, for example, name a new mineral, but those are rarely full papers). Some years you can manage two. Beyond that either quality goes down or it was really written by a grad student, who SHOULD have been given first authorship.\r\n\r\nJournals would be better if referees were MORE critical. I spend HOURS wading through shit papers looking for the 1% that are worth reading. I'd rather editors and reviewers and authors reduced the fluff and crap to say 50%. Wow, that would be great. Not bloody likely though since 'number of papers' is easy to evaluate and 'quality' is bloody hard. \r\n\r\nThe day we go to a 'reddit' or 'slashdot' style science publishing system is the day that groups like the churches or large corporations can subvert the system. Yes, the system is somewhat broken. Yes, there are abuses of power. No, it isn't just amateurs... it is people who've spent years 'in the trade.' And YES, that means there is a certain circularity to how decisions are made, and that  means many REALLY REVOLUTIONARY papers are rejected because they are outside the scope of what reviewers will consider.\r\n\r\n", "What percent of the market does, say, Paradigm Studio 20's have in speakers?

If the government can tax your income, do you really own your own time?\r\n\r\nOnce people are already paying for services, there's no reason to avoid using them.

Such a government would shrink drastically, once people are allowed the choice of saving money by not using govt-owned resources and private competition picks up.  In fact, such a government could hardly be called a government at all.

If we were to completely nullify emissions, that would entail a return to the stone age, without even fires to cook the meat killed by the few of us that can be supported without a free market.\r\n\r\nObviously, no one is advocating that.  But there is a scale that runs between changing nothing and stopping emissions completely, and the cost gets higher the more you go toward the latter.  The cost is certainly easier to ignore closer to the left side, but you can't argue that there is no cost.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes you describe are also a false dichotomy -- maybe global warming is real, but the effects would merely inconvenience us in a minor way.

I could imagine it happening.\r\n\r\nWal-Mart has an advantage in the US's mixed/corporatist economy: size.  In a free market, opening a new store is certainly easier for an established business than for a new business, simply because the established business probably has more capital and can re-use existing resources.  Another name for this might be economy of scale.\r\n\r\nHowever, our economy is not a free market.  It has lots of taxes, business regulations, and labor laws.  Wal-Mart already knows how to deal with these, in fact they probably have departments of lawyers, accountants, and human resources staff.  Thus, these government interventions don't hurt Wal-Mart so much.\r\n\r\nNow compare this to Mom and Pop opening a store.  They have no lawyers, no accountants, and no HR people.  They can hire them, but it's relatively much more expensive for them than it is for Wal-Mart.

The government will always favor the big guys, because the big guys have the money to pay the government.  Wal-Mart even [favors the minimum wage](), in fact.  They probably favor it right up to the price of their lowest paid worker, since it won't affect them, but will make it harder for any competitors that can't pay as much.\r\n\r\nWal-Mart may use aggressive tactics to gain customers.  However, the government amplifies their size advantage by making it much harder for small businesses to offer competition.

Well, yes, when you put it that way, I guess the free market sucks.\r\n\r\nSeriously, markets are magical wealth creators!  Every time two people trade, they both gain, because they both value what they received more than what they gave up!  There's convincing evidence of this all over the place, if you just pay attention.  Granted, most markets aren't completely free, but if you look around you, free markets are the source of everything you have that a 17'th century king would give his left arm to own.", "And price controls work just as well in the labor market as they do in commodities markets.  That is, they cause shortages and surpluses.  In the case of the minimum wage, they cause a surplus of labor.", "Suppose a mentally handicapped person wants to work to help his family, knowing that he can only work half as efficiently as the average new hire.  The owner of a small restaurant is willing to hire him for half the minimum wage (washing dishes, say), but obviously would lose money if he paid the full minimum.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a right to tell this business owner, \"No, if you're going to hire him you have to pay him the minimum wage\", when the business owner is obviously providing the man with a valuable opportunity?  Or to tell the man, \"Sorry, if you can't get hired with the minimum wage law you can't work,\" preventing him from gaining skills and earning more?  If someone wants to work they should not be forced to go on welfare because of a stupid law.\r\n\r\nYou can't place the blame on businesses for not being efficient enough.  They cannot pay people more than the profit from employing them.  As employees gain experience, becoming more profitable, their wages rise.\r\n\r\nMinimum wage work is very often just a stepping stone to higher paying work, either at the same job or another.  By removing that stepping stone, the least-able and least-experienced job seekers lose out. \r\n\r\nYou claim that the minimum wage is broadly beneficial to society.  There is absolutely no evidence of this.  Anyone can look at the people who are paid more from the minimum wage, sure, they seem to benefit.  But to ignore all the hidden effects on the free market is to ignore most of the effects of the law.  I have yet to see legislation restricting voluntary transactions between adults that is broadly beneficial to society.", "Heh, I understand your point, and I think you all may be arguing past each other.  The main problem with government power is that it's legitimized -- it's simply a matter of public belief that it's ok for government to do things for which a CEO would be figuratively lynched.  Other than that, there's nothing unique -- a company could try to tax people too, it's just that their \"subjects\" would tell them to go to hell.\r\n\r\nMostly libertarians/anarchists are arguing that government should not be exempt from the rules it imposes on others.  It's not *supposed* to be exempt, but it is and in many cases people support this.  The problem is convincing statists of the harm caused by the state -- that it's not ok to use coercion, no matter what, and everyone has a right to resist coercion, even if it's coming from the state.", "Someone who values money more than time would probably want to take an alternate route, wait until off-peak hours, or forego the use of a car entirely (me ;)\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about social-maximization, then the business owner and employees should be included in the calculation.\r\n\r\nThat aside, the main question is that if the government could maximize social benefit, why doesn't it?  Let's ignore motivation and assume that there are selfless people in government, while consumers and businessmen are selfish.  Even if you just want to help others, only in business does the market tell you when you're doing a good job.  In government you can be the most kind-hearted person, but you will only hear from those who you helped, not those whose taxes you used to do it, and you'll have no way of knowing whether you caused more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf you (a businessman) build a road and make a profit, then you know that the goods you used up to make the road are less valuable than the service you're providing, so society as a whole has benefited.  If you build a road and lose money, then you know that you are destroying wealth and hurting society, and the market is telling you this in a very persuasive way.  When a greedy businessman hurts society, he gets punished.\r\n\r\nHow does the government know how it's doing?  Sure it can ask people (let them vote), but people will vote for things as long as they think other taxpayers are going to pick up the tab.  You could say \"This road will only be financed by tolls, not taxes, so as to preserve profit and loss signals\", but if private competition is not allowed how do you know that someone wouldn't have done a better job and undercut you?  And finally, if you do allow private competition, then you've ceased to become a government!\r\n\r\nIn the real world, government-owned roads commonly do have lots of traffic which could be alleviated by tolls.  In fact, London now charges people to enter the city in order to decrease traffic, which has worked a bit.  Unfortunately, governments can only emulate the market in a very clumsy and vague manner, so London is treated as a unit even though there are probably big traffic differences for different parts.  Some parts are still very busy, but others which weren't congested still apply the charge.  And London's government is rare -- most just ignore the traffic.", "This example also shows a fallacy of Keynesianism.  The whole argument is that the government has to set interest rates and manipulate the money supply to encourage growth.  Yet, if the participants had simply borrowed scrip from one another, the same effect would have been acheived, without centralized control.  People would set their own interest rates based upon how much they valued the use of a scrip in the time it was lent out, allowing interest rates to adapt more quickly to supply and demand.\r\n\r\nAnd if people weren't willing to go out in the winter, that's because it's cold!  Just because the management defines going out to be desirable doesn't mean that there is a recession when people don't go out.  All it means is that the cold weather has dropped the value of going out for people relative to other activities that don't require babysitting.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this experiment ignores the main problem with currency debasement in the real world.  Money that the government prints goes directly to big banks, so they get the benefit of exchanging it for goods without having actually produced any value.  The average joe gets shafted, since by the time the money gets to him prices have long since risen to adapt to the increase in money.", "This doesn't mean that the minimum wage is a good thing -- Wal-mart supports it too.  Businesspeople hate competition, even though many claim to love it.  If their competitors are hurt by having to pay minimum wage, they get a bigger piece of a smaller pie.\r\n\r\nThe thing I wonder about is those who say the minimum wage has a positive effect on their business.  Do they mean it hurts their competitors, while having no effect on their own business?  If they are affected, and they think that's good, why didn't they just pay more in the first place?  Or is it an ideological thing?", "&gt; It's a lot harder to substitute for an interstate. And if highways really did choose favorite brands, you might buy a Pontiac instead of a Toyota to get the rush-hour lane, not because the Pontiac is actually a good car.\r\n\r\nThis analogy is a good try, but somewhat flawed.  Just because the traditional model of internet service is through cables doesn't mean it will always be that way.  ISPs who try to limit bandwidth in annoying ways will find themselves losing customers to wireless/satellite ISP start-ups.  Letting the market solve this may seem slow, but in the long run the proliferation of new technologies will more than make up for it.  If government gets involved, it will kill the incentive for new and better technologies to compete with the old ISPs.", "But what about the daytime is special or \"proper\"?  I would think that forcing a child to grow up before he/she's ready isn't real parenting, any more than treating a maturing child like a baby is.  Children mature and require less bonding naturally, if they are given the opportunity to leave their comfort zone but not forced into it.  In fact, I would argue that \"five years\" is wrong because it implies that all children develop at the same rate -- some might be ready at two or three, while others could take six.", "On the other hand, profit maximization gets you a lot closer to maximum usage than free (subsidized somehow), which tends to produce traffic jams.  Profiteers will want to up the price around peak hours until the density drops enough for maximum throughput.  This will sort people by their willingness to pay for speed -- people who aren't in a hurry will tend to use less direct routes or shift their schedules to avoid rush hour.  This spreads out road usage and makes it more efficient, similar to how airline flights are booked.  It also reduces pollution, since the tolls will encourage some people to use mass transit options.", "&gt; Other plans called for reflective films to be laid over deserts or white plastic islands to be floated on the world's oceans, both as ways to reflect more sunlight into space.\r\n\r\nI once read an article about a guy who had the idea of using self-reproducing robots to crunch up and process an inch of sand in the Sahara and use it to make solar panels.

Sure, the profit/loss incentive is not as strong as that of a highly competitive market, but it's still far stronger than the incentive of bureaucrats to do a good job, since they are paid through taxes.\r\n\r\nI am talking about monopolies in the sense of companies that capture most of the market without using government intervention.  Standard Oil, for example, drastically lowered the price of oil to drive its competitors out of business.  By the time an \"anti-competitive\" lawsuit was brought against them, they had actually lost some market share to competitors who were starting to catch up.  The consumer benefited hugely from Standard Oil's pursuit of monopoly.", "THANK you!  I would add that Galbraith is not alone in treating government agents as somehow angelically immune to everything we know about how people act in a free market.

It's like a tax of 3% a year.\r\n\r\nTechnological innovation is the only reason why prices don't skyrocket, putting all of us subjects into poverty.  The cost of every product should be constantly falling at a great rate, as technology makes things cheaper to make.  In certain areas, like computers, this effect is more obvious than in others.  In some cases, tech makes things cheaper faster than inflation eats away at your bank account, and in other cases, inflation is the winner.\r\n\r\nEver wonder why things get more expensive over time?  It's not because there is more demand from a growing population, since a growing population also increases supply and economies of scale.\r\n\r\nIt's natural for government banks to print money -- it's like a tax that very few people notice, and you can easily blame it on the cost of oil, etc.", "Privatized roads are not necessarily toll roads.

The crucial criteria of them also being dirty foreigners is not met.\r\n\r\n&gt; Generalizing about \"stupid Americans\" (some of whom actually write The Simpsons) is just as retarded as talking about \"primitive Muslims\", \"cowardly French\" etc. Doing it based on their sports preference is even worse.\r\n\r\nClearly you have some preconceptions about americans yourself... you could have just as easily assumed that I was suggesting that the Simpsons has the habit of making fun of *stupid* americans (i.e.: and not non-stupid ones).", "* The National Post report was based upon a more thorough article, A colour code for Iran's \"infidels\", by one Amir Taheri, an Iranian expatriate and former editor of one of Iran's major newspapers, **a man with extensive neoconservative ties**.\r\n\r\n * Most experts put Iran 5 to 10 years away from nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\n * the widely-reported statement that Ahmadinejad supposedly made, \"Israel must be wiped off the map\" was, in fact, a mistranslation. ... A more accurate translation is \"The occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time\", a more passive statement.\r\n\r\n * It's also worth noting that the Iranian president does not control the Iranian military, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khameini does, and the Iranian government has itself denied wanting to attack Israel.\r\n\r\n * Documents have emerged that show in 2003, **Iran secretly offered peace with Israel** to the US, but **was rebuffed**.\r\n\r\n * In general there is a tendency to equate Islamic opposition to Israel with the horrific tradition of European anti-Semitism, at the same time there is little recognition in the West of growing Israeli hatred towards Arabs.\r\n\r\n * Exploiting the memory of the Holocaust to trigger a war is, as Antonia Zerbisias puts it, \"about as low as a newspaper can go\".\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neuterality dispute is about the *term* \"Persian Jews\", not about the rest of the article.\r\n\r\nGuess what?

Paul?  Embraced onto the collective bosoms of redditers.  Clearly the only proper course of action.", "I just finished the most OUTLANDISH argument of my life.  For the past 4-5 hours, I have been arguing with this guy who kept claiming that:\r\n\r\n&gt; **Mathematics can be qualitative, not just quantitative.**\r\n\r\nTo me, that statement seems wrong on such a basic fundamental level that I cannot readily comprehend how anyone could possibly argue in favour of it.  But I kept an open mind.  For 4-5 hours, I patiently went along with statement after statement, persuasion after persuasion and countered it as best I could.\r\n\r\nWhat made it more difficult is that my opponent seems to not want to specify with crystal clarity what he means.  One of his arguments was \"because mathematics can tell us qualitative things [, it is qualitative]\".\r\n\r\nI gather he means things like using mathematics to figure out whether or not a near-earth asteroid will zoom by or crash into the pacific ocean.\r\n\r\nI would then point out that while the information gained is arguably qualitative, it is gained mathematically in a quantitative way.  This did not convince him that he was wrong, though nor did he refuse to give a different line of argument by which he felt himself right.\r\n\r\nThe even more bizarre turn of events came when a friend of my opponent arrived who kindly called her father (who is a mathematics professor of some sort) to ask, \"Can mathematics be qualitative as well as quantitative?\"\r\n\r\nThe mathematics professor's reply was,\r\n&gt; \"oh, definitely yes\".\r\n\r\nThen the professor gave an example... \r\n\r\n&gt; 1. imagine you have a closed circle, **n** units in diameter. THey can be any type of unit at all.\r\n&gt; 2. It stands to reason that you can cover the circle completely with **n** planks or strips, each **1** unit wide that are infinite in length\r\n&gt; 3. The problem is, can you cover the sphere in LESS THAN N strips?\r\n\r\nApparently the answer to this is not known... and in what way this is supposed to be proof, was stated by my opponent's friend in the following way:\r\n\r\n&gt; it has almost nothing to do with any concrete quantities.  it's about manipulating concepts that have mathematical properties.  but not about any specific quantity\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at this time the mathematics professor hung up, and we were left on our own again... my opponent and his friend seemed to think that because **n** in the above does not require a specific value, it is qualitative.\r\n\r\nI retorted with, but **n** can be *any* quantitative value.  Whereas **n** could not be a qualitative value like 'blue' or 'justice' or 'fastidiousness'.\r\n\r\nWhen it turned out that we did not in fact agree on my previous sentence, I had shortly thereafter decided to call it a night and leave the twilight zone.\r\n\r\nWas I wrong?

Julius II's didn't even start commissioning Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's Vatican Stanze (School of Athens &amp;c) didn't start until 1508. These works don't exactly represent a decline, except by Preraphealite standards which would judge them as over-sophisitcated and lacking in primitive simplicity. (That's IT: your friend's a Preraphaelite! Well **history is not on his or her side; such Victorian predilections are a mere blip in the history of Western aesthetics**.) The generation after the giant Raphael (and the giant Durer in the North) is a much better candidate for cultural and artistic decline--a story complicated by Michaelangelo's inconvenient longevity. Historians have often pointed to the 1527 Sack of Rome as a downturn in artistic ferment, or at least in the unparalleled ascendancy of Italy. I would add that Western painting of around 1500 can scarcely be separated from the other visual arts, including the still-young (to the West) technology of print, brought to incredible levels of sophistication by Durer and others in precisely the post-1500 decades.

Paul just refuses to acknowledge anything of substance in criticism of him... like I said above.\r\n\r\n&gt; Or he picks the ones that are answerable and ignores those that seem to be a waste of time.

Another reason I disagree is that I think our morality is in fact an evolutionarily stable strategy, and this is not a utilitarian criterion because it is defined over a many-player game where each player plays on the basis of his own self interest, rather than altruistically trying to maximize the sum of happiness over all people.", "On the matter of politicians themselves, there's a Buchanan that I do pay very serious attention to, and that's James Buchanan, who considered democracy from an economic standpoint. He considered what the incentives are in a democracy. And what he discovered was, to put it in a very small nutshell, that power corrupts. In short, we can never expect much out of our politicians.

You've decided to focus on the rather insignificant and rather common innacuracies of the administration. Every politician lies. There are jokes about this. No, you truly are not serious if you focus on his lies and supposed lies. You need to focus on his policis, on the wisdom or lack thereof of his policies. But instead you focus on the administration's supposedly poor grasp of reality, and frankly, it's not that poor, and the grasp on reality of the anti-war and anti-bush crowd also leaves much to be desired. Hence the term \"Bush Derangement Syndrome\".

It also assumes, without proof, certain highly expertise-dependent claims about what an implosion is \"exactly\" like, claims which again bear the burden of proof, also not satisfied here.\r\n\r\nMy version is plausible on the face of it, not relying on any counterintuitive claims. For example, we intuit that very high heat for a long time will weaken many materials.\r\n\r\nYour devil's-advocate version requires that the reader\r\n\r\na) Have expert knowledge in certain fields, and\r\nb) Agree with the supposedly expert claims that you allude to.\r\n\r\nOr, less charitably, your version requires that the reader\r\n\r\na) be about as ignorant of physics and the like as most laypersons, and\r\nb) be gullible when he/she reads the impressive-sounding claims of crackpots about physics and so on\r\n\r\n", "There are, however, two different conceptions of morality:\r\n\r\na) One which asks, \"what should I do\"\r\n\r\nb) One which asks, \"what do I have the right to do\"\r\n\r\nFor example: if you pass someone in the street who needs money, it may be that at the same time you have the right to refuse him, but at the same time you should give him some money - i.e., it is the more noble, the more saintly thing to do.\r\n\r\nOr to look at it another way, if you do something you have no right to do, and people find out, you may be in deep trouble. You might go to jail. But if you fail to do something that you should do - the noble thing - people may simply feel disappointment, or possibly understand that you are only human.\r\n\r\nAnother difference: if you ask, \"what do I have the right to do\", then maybe you have the right to do either one, maybe neither is prohibited. If neither is prohibited, then the answer to the question of what you *will* do is left up to your personal, nonmoral preference. If you ask, \"what should I do\", then the question asks you to make a choice, and implies that there *is* a moral choice. If the answer is, \"you should flip the switch\", then that answer means that flipping the switch is the more moral choice. If the answer is, \"you should not flip the switch\", then that answer means that flipping the switch is the less moral choice. But what if you want to say, \"you have the right to flip the switch, but you also have the right not to flip the switch, and you may prefer one, or the other\"? The question \"what should I do\" does not have a place for that position, but the question, \"what do I have the right to do\" does.\r\n\r\nOne way to look at these puzzles is to rephrase the question, from \"what should I do\", to, \"what do I have a right to do\". And a good way to do that is to imagine that a lot of people are looking at you, at what you do, that your neighbors and a lot of police are all standing around watching your every move, and that when it's over you will be in their power to either let pass or arrest and try and convict, based on their idea of whether you did something you had no right to do. (though the idea here is that the court will be a moral court: you will be convicted for doing evil things like murder, not because the state happens to have declared murder illegal but because everyone around you considers murder heinous. You can grant them your moral values by switching roles, supposing that you are judging someone who has done something, has allowed 5 to die rather than flip the switch, or who flipped the switch. You ask yourself whether you would convict someone as a murderer if he did one or the other.)\r\n", "&gt; So if you were doing experiments in New York that didn't involve grabbing people off the streets and killing them, but did involve creating a poisonous gas you had no means of containing and it ended up killing the same number of people in nearby neighborhoods, then that would be as easily justifiable as the Iraq war for you?\r\n\r\nFirst of all I don't think the Iraq war is justified. I thought I made that point.\r\n\r\nSecond, on the hypothetical situation, it depends on whether you were negligent. It is possible that a judge will rule that you had no way of knowing. But I don't find the analogy satisfactory because it's not close enough. War is fighting. So really, a good analogy would be to fighting. So: if you are defending yourself against someone who is trying to kill you, and you inadvertently kill someone in the streets of New York, then you may indeed not be culpable culpable for the deaths - the fault may lie with the person who attacked you.\r\n\r\nAnd in war you are fighting, you are defending yourself and your fellows, so there's a similar situation.\r\n\r\n&gt;This truth about me does not bother me.\r\n\r\nNor should it. I see too many people paying lip service to ideals which in the back of my mind I really doubt they will keep, and self-awareness is good, and there's no shame in being human and having the reactions that a human is very likely to have. Edit: However, if you kill innocents to save your son and you're caught, you will be tried, probably convicted, and likely executed. So in the sense of \"a capital offense is wrong\", then it's wrong to kill random innocents to save your son. (Again, that is a simplified statement: it's not necessarily wrong if you weren't trying to kill them, they accidently got in the way, etc. - qualifications which the format of Jon Stewart's show didn't really allow, and by the way this is one of the reasons you can't have a really good debate on TV, even if you try.)", "I guess the question is, why are you seeing so many conspiracy theories.

The state government does not protect your stabbing victim from you. At most your police protect your stabbing victim from you, and they are (or at least easily can be) local to your city or town. Thus you've failed to defend the state - either the national state or the state state (e.g. California, Florida, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe history of the state in California is interesting. Very briefly, though: before government stepped in, there was private justice, what you might call vigilante justice. It worked very well. The state stepped in but not because private justice was not working. The state stepped in because it is in the nature of the state to expand, to increase its power, and to come into conflict with neighbors - hence the Mexican-American war. The state did not expand to save the Californians from criminals.

There are actually good economic reasons for zealously defending the institution of private property against the short-sightedness of people who are looking for quick fixes for the obsession du jour and who do not understand the ramifications of a weakening of the institution of private property. On the matter of the empirical study of regulation, I cite Coase (famous economist, won the Nobel prize). Here's Coase talking about a bunch of empirical studies of the effects of regulation.\r\n\r\n&gt;Reason: What's an example of bad regulation?\r\n\r\n&gt;Coase: I can't remember one that's good. Regulation of transport, regulation of agriculture-- agriculture is a, zoning is z. You know, you go from a to z, they are all bad. There were so many studies, and the result was quite universal: The effects were bad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that's what a world-class economist says about the effects of regulation. In the other corner, we've got a bunch of folks whose first instinct the moment they face a problem is apparently to say, \"let's regulate this to make it better.\" And you've got libertarians saying, \"hold on, wait a second, what about the fact that regulation almost invariably makes things worse?\"\r\n\r\nAnd to those who say, \"but in this case the regulation is obviously a good idea,\" I answer, what do you think people thought in every other case that regulation was imposed? Yes, of course they thought it was a good idea then too. Otherwise they wouldn't have imposed it. Regulation looks good superficially, but as Coase discovered it rarely if ever works out well in practice.", "&gt;So take it easy. It's just a web site.

As a libertarian, should I support or oppose Obama? More generally speaking, as a libertarian, should I abandon the Republican party which has done so little that is defensible from a libertarian standpoint and so much that is indefensible? Let us look.\r\n\r\n&gt;The junior Senator from Illinois observed that in 2006 many of America's people \"have had their faith shaken.\" \"The world has changed but things in Washington have not changed\" and this has led to an assault on the American dream. Politicians in Washington are constrained by \"smallness.\" \"The timidity of our politics is holding us back.\"\r\n\r\nSmallness? What smallness? Republicans today are big government Republicans, but Obama seems to think they are small-government Republicans. That's a point against Obaama.\r\n\r\n&gt;Barack Obama said that the solution to this problem lies in the American people. It's time for the electorate to reassert their will, to say they've \"had enough.\" \"Enough of broken promises and failed leadership. Enough of can't do and won't try.\" He argued that we all should have had enough of an Administration that can't make our ports safe but will spend billions on crony contracts. That claims to be serious about defending the homeland, but could not respond effectively to Hurricane Katrina. That can't come up with plan for Iraq or to ensure our national competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't say much, it's negative about Republicans but does not give us Obama's vision, so on to the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n&gt;Obama remarked that the roots of this problem are clear. They lie \"in the philosophy of this administration, in their believe that government is the problem.\" He said that taken to the extreme this ideology is \"social Darwinism. The belief that we are all on our own. That each of us is responsible for our own education, healthcare, and levees.\"\r\n\r\nWhoa, big problem there. Obama is attacking the belief that government is the problem. That sure is not any sort of libertarian statement. It's directly against libertarian, it's 180 degrees against libertarian. Republicans have not by any stretch of the imagination been governing to impress the more libertarian component of their constituencies. The big Republican misdeeds from a libertarian standpoint have been massive increases in government activity, starting with the war in Iraq. Government wiretapping is another concern. Airport nonsecurity, massive increases in welfare spending, proposed anti-homosexual legislation - all of these are uses or attempted uses by the Republicans of government power, and rther than attack this massive use of government power by Republicans, Obama chooses to attack Republicans for paying lip service to the idea that government is the problem!\r\n\r\nWell, government is the problem. And that sentiment pretty much defines the libertarian point of view, so Obama is setting himself up as farther away from the libertarians than President Bush. Which is quite an accomplishment.\r\n\r\n&gt;The junior Senator from Illinois noted that the GOP approach does not work in a democracy. He argued that the American way of life has two components: \"individual initiative and mutual regard, the belief that I am my brother's keeper and my sister's keeper.\" Democrats must reassert that mutual regard is a vital component of government.\r\n\r\nThat's vague rhetoric, but the notion of \"brother's keeper\", especially in the light of the previous assertions by Obama, suggest that Obama is making the case for a massive increase in government's role in our lives. Americans can of course be their brother's keeper by means of private charity, but Obama isn't campaigning to become president of a private charity, he's a politician, his solutions are government solutions, so he evidently wants government to do what private charities do. And that is not libertarian.\r\n\r\n&gt;Obama concluded that it is time for Americans to have a debate about where we are going and what we are about. Republicans have a timid vision, the downsizing of democracy. He called upon Democrats to proclaim, \"that every American family deserves the right to the American dream.\" He argued that all Americans deserve to \"dream without limits and achieve without constraints.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans have a timid vision? Of what, of the government's role in society? Presumably. Well, if Obama thinks the Republicans have a timid vision of the government's role then that's another strike against Obama (and against the Democratic party, in which Obama is a, maybe the, rising star).\r\n\r\n&gt;On Thursday, Barack Obama shared his vision of nation building. His image of an America restored because its citizens have regained the ability to dream and to live in community. He remembered the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., \"The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.\" Noting that we all need to work together to bend the arc, he implored his rapt audience to join in the struggle for an America with liberty and justice for all. Obama concluded, \"If [after 105 years] Marguerite Lewis isn't tired, then I'm not tired.\"\r\n\r\nMore vague rhetoric. In conclusion, Obama sets himself up as being on the opposite side of Republicans from libertarians. Obama is for an expansive view of government.\r\n\r\n", "There's been a trigger for this reversal among this and other conservatives, and the trigger is that Bush has been too soft for their taste on illegal immigrants, and that's upsetting the conservative base, I mean *really* upsetting them, I mean they're talking about the President in much the same hate-filled tones as the leftiest of the left. Bush has alienated a lot of conservatives with his soft stance on immigration, and they are now reassessing his whole presidency in the light of their anger over it.\r\n\r\nSomething similar happened with the conservative Andrew Sullivan. He denies it but the coincidence is too stark: his position on Bush reversed when Bush came out against homosexuals, specifically against homosexual marriage. This was a great betrayal and (I believe) Sullivan reassessed Bush's whole presidency in the light of his anger. Sullivan claims that's not it, but I think Sullivan is only human, and now that Bush has pissed, I mean really pissed off conservatives with his stance on immigration (just check the blogs if you don't believe me) I see it happening again.\r\n\r\nSadly, for myself I'm very \"soft\" on immigration, so it's disappointing to me that Bush is being abandoned on account this particular thing.

And the biggest distinction is whether civilians/innocents are the intentional targets. Even in the Iraq war, soldiers who get out of hand and deliberately and with malice murder civilians, have committed a wrong and are recognized to have done so, and where there are allegations of that happening those allegations are investigated. You can be cynical about this but they do at least go through the motions, so they do recognize a distinction, even in the middle of war, between deaths where innocents are specifically targeted, and deaths where civilians are inadvertently killed.\r\n\r\nAnd you can say, \"but the original statement did not mention the qualification about the killing being deliberately targeted\" - yeah, but that was Stewart's formulation, and anyway it's quite normal to make a statement that is a simplification of your full view, especially on television with time constraints.

CEO pay\r\n2. Health care\r\n3. College education\r\n\r\nIn each of those three cases, the people paying the bills often aren't in control of the pursestrings.  Going over each in turn:\r\n\r\n* With CEO pay, the shareholders elect a board which hires a CEO.  In order to consider shareholder's ability to change the board as a real source of power, we need to actually see it exercised.  How many times have you seen shareholders fire their board?  Thus, prices spiral.\r\n\r\n* Most people don't pay for their own health care.  They are removed two steps from it: their company pays premiums to an insurance company, and the insurance company pays the doctors and drug companies.  The insurance company can exert some price pressures, so health care costs don't rise anywhere near as much as CEO pay.\r\n\r\n* College studensts hardly ever pay their own bills.  The money comes from a variety of loans, government, and parents.  Parents are often pushed by society into thinking \"education is worth any cost\" and pay appropriately.  I think more parents are catching on, but that's running up against limited supply.  The number of spots for freshmen in   any given set of top-tier schools (however you wish to define \"top-tier\") is going to remain relatively constant over the next generation, but the parents with disposable income to compete for those spots is going to grow.\r\n\r\nWhew.  I digressed.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, shareholders need to figure out a way to exert control over their board.  The only practical way for most small shareholders to do this is to only buy stock in companies that have reasonable CEO pay.

Maybe the landlord can recoup the cost of mortgage payments and taxes and insurance and repairs each month, but maybe not.  In fact, if you consider the fact that two different landlords in identical buildings could be paying drastically different amounts on their mortgages, there's no reason to assume that PITI == rent.  Maybe the property is cashflow positive, maybe it's negative.\r\n\r\nSome landlords assuredly have negative cash flow on their property.  In these cases, the renters are *not* paying for repairs.\r\n\r\nThere's all sorts of reasons landlords find themselves in a position where they have to rent at a loss.  Most of them have to do with the state of the rental market -- if the market won't pay enough to cover costs, well, tough cookies.

I hope it doesn't get down-modded just because of the title.\r\n\r\nBut I think the biggest weakness is right here:\r\n\r\n*\"Piracy is wrong because it is a bad thing for the economy when people choose to behave outside its forces for their own personal gain.\"*\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily true. It's more accurate to say that it is *disruptive* for the economy when people choose to behave outside its forces for their own personal gain.\r\n\r\nNow, is that disruption a bad thing? That depends on whether or not you believe that the current state of the economy is good. I think many would argue that the current entertainment market is a complete and utter mess in need of some serious disruption. It is not maximizing compensation to artists, or getting the highest quality content to the people who are most likely to enjoy it. Rather, it's manipulating people into liking the content that's available and maximizing compensation to large organizations -- which then compensate the artists the minimum amount necessary in order to get them to keep working.\r\n\r\nSo the argument goes, anyway. This may well be an exaggeration or oversimplification, but I think there's definitely truth in it.\r\n\r\n*\"The real danger of intellectual property theft is not a loss in sales but the devaluing of the property due to higher saturation in the market.\"*\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing if the property is overvalued.

What I find despicable is the standard jewelers' line that a good engagement ring should cost several weeks (or even several months) salary.

I said I suspected that the truth in this situation was somewhere in the middle. I never said it was or that it must be so.\r\n\r\n&gt; So he's argueing against a position I never even took.\r\n\r\nMaybe so. But it sounds to me like you're backpedaling. I know you didn't claim to have ironclad logical proof that the truth *must* lie somewhere in the middle, but you still clearly believed that it did -- without providing any sensible reason why. It came across as a shallow platitude glossing over an important issue.\r\n\r\nI think the reason he responded the way he did is because \"I believe the truth lies somewhere in the middle\" has become a bit of a cliche. It's a one-liner representative of the sort of wishy-washy superficiality the media shows when dealing with difficult subjects: just throw up both sides and you've done your job as an objective reporter.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your choice of words is rather ironic, because Colbert himself used the exact same phrase during his Daily Show correspondent days in a bit lampooning the media for exactly this sort of thing. I believe the example he used was \"Does Jon Stewart molest children? Some say yes, some say no.

As long as it's a choice.\r\n\r\n[This article]() makes an excellent argument for virginity as a conscious choice. I don't agree with everything she says, but she is obviously thinking for herself and trying to do the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe problem is with chastity, virginity, abstinence, etc. being advocated as systematically superior for everyone. Any rational study done on these programs shows that they are at best nonproductive and at worst counterproductive.\r\n\r\nAnd anyone who actually thinks about the problem can clearly see why. Essentially what they're saying is that sex should ideally happen between two people in a trusting, committed relationship. I'm a liberal atheist, and I agree with this -- not only because it's physically and emotionally safer, but because it makes for better sex. The problem is that all of these complex and difficult issues -- trust, mutual respect, care and consideration for each other -- are being neatly packaged under the label \"marriage\". Yes, I agree that that's what marriage *should* be, but there is absolutely nothing to guarantee that that is what it *is*. And if young people have it hammered into their heads that marriage is the only acceptable gateway to sex, then when those young people reach adolescence and young adulthood, guess what they'll do? Get married at the wrong time, to the wrong people, for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nThe biggest sin of \"abstinence before marriage\" campaigns (and, again, I am strongly distinguishing between the mass public relations campaigns and individual choice informed by personal and family advice) is to put the cart before the horse. To teach young people that marriage is what you do to *make* a stable relationship, instead of what you do *after* you have made a stable relationship. To push them into getting married because they are physically attracted to someone instead of gradually developing experience with relationships and gaining a true understanding of the level of commitment marriage should entail.\r\n\r\nThe end result, again, should be easily predictable.

It redefines morality as \"whatever an authority figure says is right\". It all allegedly comes from a source (such as the Bible), but that's just window dressing. The important thing is that that source is interpreted by a single person, or small group of people. And the followers are trained to accept whatever that person or those people say as absolute moral truth. This can be accomplished because it goes with our natural desire for simplicity. Hashing out moral quandaries is *hard*. It's messy and inconclusive. OTOH, accepting a moral absolute as a fundamental axiom is nice and easy; it saves a lot of work and confusion. All you need is an authority who seems to know what he's talking about to make you feel good about accepting his claims.\r\n\r\nThis is an extraordinarily powerful tool when held in the right hands, Because it makes large groups of people very compliant. And, in fact, it's hardly limited to religion. It has been done with Communism, product marketing, and a million other things. But it does illustrate the real danger of right-wing Christian fundamentalism (or what is generally referred to as \"fundamentalism\" -- I know the word has a number of very different meanings) in America today. Even though its followers are not generally going out and beating up gay people or blowing up abortion clinics, they represent a very large group of people who can be easily manipulated into believing (and, ultimately, doing) basically whatever their leaders want them to.", "&gt; Well, you can see what high salaries have done for the legal profession.

And who here has had the opportunity to deal with various orders of infinity on a regular basis (in the physical realm, that is)?\r\n\r\nE.g., we typically deal with modest speeds, and these are much much less than the speed of light.

So pi \"exists\" in the sense that under certain mathematical assumptions and definitions, it takes on the current understanding.  But, the point of the article is -- **what if** Reality does not adhere to such assumptions, say particularly it is discrete?

My point is that given our current military state, I fail to see how the President could go to war with Iran unless there was a clear danger being presented.  Even if he wanted to wage war on Iran for the motives you raise, -- I would claim that he would not be able to unless there was an overwhelming security need to go to war.  And given an overwhelming security need, and one might arguably develop soon under certain conditions, it seems foolish to look for other motives and claim those are somehow the \"main\" motives of his decision, and that he is therefore a Bad Person (unless of course you could document proof in such an event, but this seems very unlikely).", "Well, it's about tolerating those who it is the fad to tolerate.

Learn how to use it to take pictures from close up, far away, and medium range.  Also be comfortable with distances in between those, because you might need to take a picture from far-medium or medium-close.  In a pinch, you can cover lack of practice in medium range with a hybrid \"near/far\" approach, which is rare and advanced and will gain you recognition if you master it.\r\n\r\n3.

Make sure you are pointing the camera at your subjects, or you risk taking a picture of something else.\r\n\r\n5. When taking a picture, make sure you push the right button -- don't just say \"click\" like you did in kindergarten when you pretended your fingers were a camera.  If you did, you could still pretend to look at the make-believe pictures with your friends but you might not be as successful a wedding photographer, unless you give a substantial discount. \r\n", "\r\n\r\n\"A piece of skin the size of a quarter\r\ncontains more than three million cells, 12\r\nfeet of nerves, 100 sweat glands, 50 nerve\r\nendings, and almost three feet of blood vessels.\"\r\n\r\nThe Human Connection\r\nAshley Montagu and Floyd Matson\r\nMcGraw-Hill, 1979\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\"Circumcision removes a piece of skin\r\nalmost equivalent to a 3 x 5 index card.\"\r\n\r\nSay No to Circumcision! 40 Compelling Reasons\r\nThomas J.

The reason this article is talking about a pro-experimentation group is because of undercover footage taken at UK animal labs which started off a major campaign by protestors to shut down those labs.  This led to a new designation of protestors as \"terrorists\" in the UK, which the author seems to be quite happy about.  \r\n\r\nThe second question is, are these experiments useful?\r\n\r\nThe [Physicians Committe for Responsible Medicine argues that it is not.]()  In fact, it IS harmful in two ways: drugs that pass animal testing which then hurt humans (Fen-Phen, Vioxx, Celebrex, Ambien, etc.) and drugs that are toxic to animals but help humans (e.g. penicillin and rats).  The article's citation of Thalidomide is ironic because it did pass animal testing; but you don't know what is going to happen with a pregnant woman until you try it on one.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of animal experimentation does not even involve pharmaceuticals, but is what is called \"basic research\".  What this usually means is a University research lab applying for a grant, then repeating some experiment done thousands of times before (say, on lead toxicity) in order to artificially create employment for people with a degree but no real job.  This is essentially what most pro-testing advocates are fighting for -- the gravy train of government grants which supplies them with paychecks.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical animal testing is a formality designed not to help ensure the safety of drugs for humans, but as a CYA move in the case of lawsuits so that there is something to point to; a bit like \"no one ever got fired for buying Microsoft\" even though there is no actual warranty.  Humans have in effect become guinea pigs because animal testing is a poor predictor of complex drug interactions with human physiology.  Pharmaceutical companies argue that very line when they have something that looks promising in the petri dish but doesn't work as hoped on animals, in order to get permission to move to human testing.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is better computer models.  In the meantime, animal experiments are misleading, and as conducted currently, cruel and unregulated.", "You will almost invariably find that those who commit armed robbery already have a rap sheet.

Being locked up is supposed to BE the punishment -- not all the other stuff that comes with it.

Go in as a teenager for stealing a stereo, come out as someone who hates society.  Prison rape just guarantees a never-ending source of violent crime, creating a feedback loop for the prison industry.  Violent crime is CREATED by our institutions.", "&gt;Laws are necessarily a one-size-fits-all, and it's simply not possible to fashion a sliding scale for such cases.\r\n\r\nActually, there is a sliding scale for such cases.  Penalties differ based on the ages of the two parties; e.g. some divide it up into 14 and under, 15-18, and if the older party is above or below 18, 22, etc.  It differs by state.  It turned out to be necessary because one-size-fits-all penalties often were severely disproportionate.\r\n\r\n&gt; your implied claim that all 15-year-olds are capable of consent. They aren't.\r\n\r\nI don't see the problem with two 15-year-olds boning each other, even though it's probably illegal most places.  Or with two 17-year-olds... and you know one will turn 18 before the other, which suddenly makes it a different type of crime in some jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nOf course in many states the age is 16 which kind of shows how capricious the issue is.  You can be a lifelong sex offender in one state for what would just be boning your high school girlfriend/boyfriend in another.\r\n", "Linked article fails to establish (or at least explain) the mechanism by which the claimed action happens.\r\n\r\nFurther, it makes ludicrous claims like \"The fact that there is a place called Japan, with people and factories, is quite irrelevant to Americans' well-being,\" which makes it hard to take seriously.

How's that for hurt?  And it seems like losing an industry will have quite a ripple effect.\r\n\r\n&gt; It predicts second that if you protect American producers in one industry from foreign competition, there must be a net loss in economic efficiency.\r\n\r\nI'll grant you this -- if you can do the same job for less elsewhere, then it makes sense at the time to outsource.  However, this ignores three key parts: one, it reduces local infrastructure and expertise.  Two, any economic efficiency may be offset by the company pocketing the savings and concentrating it e.g. in its executive compensation, rather than reducing the cost of goods.  Three, the best short-term strategy is not the same as the best long-term strategy.  Over time you may see a net GAIN in efficiency.\r\n\r\nIf he's talking about NTT, which from the following article he seems to be, then here's a money quote:\r\n\r\n*\"The econometric evidence for NTT was mixed, and again; highly technical.

Interestingly, in the [original article]() \r\n&gt; American babies are three times more likely to die in their first month as children born in Japan, and newborn mortality is 2.5 times higher in the United States than in Finland, Iceland or Norway, Save the Children researchers found.\r\n\r\nNone of these countries are listed as deviating from WHO norms; neither were Australia, Canada, and the UK which apparently also have lower infant mortality rates. The article also goes on to say that blacks have a much higher proportion of underweight children, which the \"correction\" in \"debunking\" appears to manipulate. (I.e. factor out having more underweight children in the US. Since they're more likely to die, this reduces the mortality rate, but begs the question, \"Why are more children underweight?\" I don't think technology is the only answer.)\r\n\r\nOf course, presumably \"Save the Children\" has an agenda too, so a grain of salt is warranted.

My general, overall criticism would be it just didn't say that much that I found, to use a slightly overblown word, enlightening. It is not news that big companies have problems with innovation, and because they have an investment in their current technology, they often miss the boat on a new product.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I found many of the advantages of the 'outside' were fairly obvious, and thus your writing about them went on too long. I thought the Great American Novel trope was *way* too long. I thought you should have at least mentioned Ramanujan as a footnote regarding wild outsiders in the hard sciences. (And, as a student of history, I think you would recognize that previously much important and interesting science was done by outsiders, but that actually probably supports your point, since at those time universities were more political) I didn't like the gratuitous government bashing after the Novel metaphor.\r\n\r\nI did like your discussion of accurate tests, and the relation they have to the prevalence of politics.\r\n\r\nRegarding eminence and delegation, I think you overlooked, or at least under-represented the power of *leverage*.

The compulsory conditions included prohibitions on blasphemy against Islam, entering into sexual relations or marriage with a Muslim woman, proselytizing among Muslims, and assisting the enemies of Islam. The desirable conditions included a requirement to wear distinctive apparel, a prohibition to visibly display religious symbols, wine, or pork, ringing church bells, or loudly praying, a requirement to bury deads unobtrusively, and finally, a prohibition on riding horse or camels, but not donkeys.  The latter restrictions were largely symbolic in nature and were designed to highlight the inferiority of dhimmis compared to Muslims.  The overarching principle in the treatment of dhimmis is encapsulated in the statement: \"Islam is exalted, and nothing is exalted above it\". which is based on a Qur'anic verse (Qur'an 9:33) establishing the preeminence of Islam over other religions.]()\r\n\r\nAs to what the Christians have done...

Of course libertarians, like most religious adherents, believe their creed is the absolute objective truth of the universe, and will not refrain from qualifying their statements, like a Catholic who says that Jesus was born from a virgin woman who was free from original sin, without sticking the, to them, unnecessary qualifier of \"according to the Catholic Church.\" Likewise the libertarian simply asserts his way is the general way.\r\n\r\nThe 2d chart is 1) a libertarian propaganda tool and 2) all but unknown in European politics. So much for generality. The view itself that it is possible to operate a disjunction between political and social cohesion/spread (tendentiously called liberty) is itself non-neutral.\r\n\r\nI know what democrats and republicans are about, roughly, although it's not my country and I concern more with parties I can actually vote for, like the People's Party, Socialist Workers' Party, etc. As it often happens, you cannot tell from the name whether they're left or right wing (oddly, the People's Party is right wing, something we would call Christian-democrat, which would probably not make much sense to US readers previously unacquainted with the term). So, I am familiar with the 2d chart and its implications, and the way it fits in US political landscape (and the way it does not fit in many other countries' like mine).\r\n\r\nJust for an example of very important \"dimensions\" in some European countries, consider the nationalist question: should the State centrally hold power or should it be distributed territorially? Should there be 0, 1, or more than 1 official languages? Should subsidiary languages be official in the territories where they are spoken? All these questions are touched not at all by the socio-economic reductionist 2d table that libertarians like so much, as it makes their case a lot easier. How about traditional European-style non-capitalist anarchism? Where does it fall on that chart? Economic self-determination can lead to many different solutions, the 2d chart only plots the central State ownership versus distributed market-driven ownership, and those are not the two exclusive ways of going about it.\r\n\r\nConsider this: to some people, freedom means being able to buy a piece of land, enclose it, and exercise a quasi-absolute exclusive property right on it, barring access, etc. To other people, it means being able to walk around the countryside without disturbing the land, no matter to whom it may belong, being able to bath in the lakes, pick berries, etc. They're two different \"social contracts\", and their proponents would say theirs contains the most freedom, and the other unduely constraints freedom, which is why freedom, as an abstract, is almost useless to choose which one of them is better.\r\n", "The free market is one way to do it, for sure. I doubt it is the only efficient resource allocator in algorithmic space though. Also price signaling works in some detrimental ways for society, in that it is 1d. In a price-signalled environment there's evolutionary pressure for agents to act in a way that discounts anything but pricing. For example, if you make purchase decisions on the basis of social effort, labour conditions, etc, you will be less successful in a capitalist economy and your power to influence things will erode. In a few generations the memetic complex you carry will be eliminated by people better placed to promote their individualistic, price-only memetic complex.\r\n", "You have some good points, but what is wrong about having sex with a minor? Is it the having sex itself or is it the coercion or use of power as you say? Because it isn't really true that you can't write laws to discriminate these situations. In Germany for example, iirc, there's a maturity consideration (who says what's mature? judges of course). In Spain the age of consent is 13, but if the person having sex with a minor is over 18 and they use deception or coercion or use their positions of authority then it has a different implication for the law. So it's not true the only thing you can do is place an arbitrary age limit.\r\n\r\nAlso there are very few studies (some of which actually claim it can be good for the minor) about minors having consentual non-abusive relationships with people substantially older than themselves. So arguments about how it's obviously sick and it is very bad for the child and all that are usually based on cases in which coercion, deception, authority, are utilized over the minor. It would be like comparing normal consentual sex with rape and sexual harassment at work, they have little to do with each other.\r\n\r\nEdit: corrected age of consent for Spain from 12 to 13.\r\n", "The only reason I give a shit about the Earth is because man is not particularly autonomous yet.

Let me just point out that moral rights of authorship are inalienable and cannot be extinguished even by authorial decision. Perhaps this makes it clearer to you the difference in conception. Copyright is an economic bargain with authors. We can argue on whether it is a good or a bad bargain for the people to make. Moral rights are the legal recognition of a strong intuition that I, together with most people commenting in this thread, appears to share: to wit, that it is not legitimate, it is an outrage, to misrepresent oneself as the author of a creative work.

Also, in the end, if Europe becomes an islamic majority place, my reaction is \"so what\". Should we forbid Islamic religion? Islamic conversion? Sterilize Islamic people?

But then they could've spent their time replacing old shoes (upgrading aging inner-city infrastructure) or adding a new book to the library (curing cancer).\r\n\r\nThe Broken Window Fallacy applies only to half your argument, the contention that this will stimulate economic growth.  To extend it further, imagine that the shopkeeper (industry) has old windows that are made with lead (CO2), and that lead may or may not be slowly leaching out into the groundwater (atmosphere) and poisoning the children (children).  By breaking the window (old processes), the boy (government) forced a cleanup.  Now, the lead (CO2) is definitely not threatening the children (children) - but we never knew for certain if the lead was threatening the children to begin with, or if they would've died from other causes (non-manmade global warming) anyway.  And it's still indisputable that the shopkeeper (industry) had to spend money to fix their window (processes), and this prevented the glazier (innovative startups) from working on their library (cure for cancer).", "I object to him on the grounds of being overly general, not being entirely wrong.  There are certainly Ph.Ds that are just academic eggheads, who know a lot but can't do anything with it.

And I'd highly recommend that people read, say, [Making Reliable Distributed Systems in the Presence of Software Errors]() or [Rabbit: A compiler for Scheme](), both Ph.D dissertations.\r\n\r\n(I should possibly mention my background here: I have a bachelor's degree and only a bachelor's degree, with no plans to go for a Ph.D and back-burnered plans to go into entrepeneurship.)", "Tracking or fire control?

Remember that SM2s are only semi-active radar homing; they need a ship-based radar to paint the target for them.\r\n\r\nGranted, I haven't really studied this stuff since I was 10 (15 years ago), so they might've upgraded the equipment since then.  If they've upgraded their SAMs to active radar homing, that would take care of everything, but (in 1991) the only active radar homing missile in the U.S. inventory was the Phoenix.\r\n\r\nInteresting to see that so many other Redditers are/were also military buffs.

But my impression was that the article suggested that it was inevitable.  I think that's *way* too strong a suggestion: we've seen what happens to other countries that go down the hyperinflation route, and I doubt any American would pick that over losing their social secruity benefits (which would be worthless under hyperinflation anyway - fixed income, remember?)\r\n\r\nI also think there's a difference between repudiating Treasury note debt vs. repudiating social security promises.  Social security is explicitly pay-as-you-go; the government has never *promised* a certain level of benefits in the future.  While it may have been mismarketed, there's been enough publicity about social security's woes that people have been warned.

If you want to start an oil company, you have to match Exxon's expertise in geology, drilling, production, transporation, and distribution.  If you want to start a beverage company, you need to get over Coca-Cola's brand advantage (though this is certainly possible; look at Nantucket Nectars).  If you want to start a semiconductor company, you need to have the $3 billion or so in capital that it takes Intel to build a new plant.\r\n\r\nSoftware is one of the few areas where it's still possible to start a business on the cash that an ordinary income can generate.  But most software markets - desktop utilities, programmer tools, database-backed consumer webapps - have been commoditized so it's increasingly difficult to make money in them.

None of them compare to reading his [shareholder letters]() straight off the web.\r\n\r\nThere are also many areas where books are the *starting* point, not the ending point.  For example, [SICP]() is a great book (and available online!).  However, if you really want to learn Scheme, you've got to start looking through the [original lambda papers]() and several journal publications that are available only online (well...a university library would probably have them, but many of us don't have access to that).  And most importantly, to grab an actual implementation, read the online documentation, and start playing with it.\r\n\r\nI find the best way to \"keep up\" is to pick an interesting, challenging, and fun project; read all you need (either online or on books) to complete that project; and then actually do the work necessary to finish it.  There's nothing quite like learning by doing.", "I'm speaking mostly in terms of the number of concepts (both syntactic and semantic) required to learn the language.  So Haskell's a large language because you need to learn monads, typeclasses, existentials, an odd function-application syntax, partial-application and function composition, 10 levels of operator precedence with arbitrary user-defined infix operators, a fairly odd lambda syntax, white-space significant layout rules, pattern matching that's *far* more powerful than anyone needs it to be (being able to pattern-match on certain operators - but not on arbitrary functions - gets confusing), algebraic data types, type constructors, partially applied type constructors, the kind system, and so on.\r\n\r\nOCaml is also a large language, though perhaps somewhat smaller, because you've got a whole object system that's incredibly powerful yet unlike anything you've ever seen before, and a module system that itself is practically a whole sub-language.  There's also some weird unexpected stuff like needing different arithmetic operators for floats vs. integer math (something Haskell solved with typeclasses).\r\n\r\nErlang, by contrast, is a *tiny* language.  You need to know the basic data type literals - tuples, lists, atoms, and records.  Pattern-matching is the exact reverse of value construction.  Other than that, you need to know basic function application, and the 3 major concurrency built-ins (spawn, send (!), and recv), and you're off.\r\n\r\nScheme also has a tiny core (30 page standard!), but you usually need records, hashtables, and objects to do any real work with it.  So it's about Erlang-sized by the time you factor in all the implementation-dependent stuff.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, here's how I'd rate other mainstream languages on the size continuum:\r\n\r\n* Very large: Common Lisp, C++, Perl\r\n* Large: Haskell, Ocaml, PHP, C#\r\n* Medium: Java, Python, Ruby, ML, Dylan\r\n* Small: Erlang, Scheme, Smalltalk, C\r\n* Very small: JavaScript, Self", "Higher gas prices, actually.\r\n\r\nIt's because if gas prices go high enough and *stay there*, it encourages people to make substantive changes to their lifestyle that drive down the demand for gas.  As a result, their *total* fuel bills drop, even though they're paying significantly higher prices for gas.\r\n\r\nFor example, a family that drives 1000 miles/month on a 20 mpg car currently pays $150/month at $3/gallon.  If gas prices rose to $4.50 a gallon, but that convinced them to buy a 40 mpg car, they'd only be paying $112.50/month.  Many people are unwilling to do this because they like the safety of a bigger car, but if *everybody* (or even a decent majority) was forced by economics to drive a compact instead of an SUV, we'd end up no less safe but with significantly lower fuel bills.", "I figured that calls were more appropriate than futures because GM customers don't *have* to buy gasoline.  A future is a contract for delivery in the future: even if you don't need the good, it gets dumped on you when the future expires.  Calls give you the right but not obligation to buy.\r\n\r\nMore likely is they took out futures for some \"minimum\" amount of gasoline (based on statistical probabilities of gas usage), and then made up the difference with calls (or alternatively a call/put collar with a larger amount made of futures).  That limits their downside risk and would probably be cheaper than a call-only portfolio.", "Of course.  Everybody who buys insurance from that firm (and likely others too, many insurance companies have \"reinsurance\" agreements where they spread the risk of large payouts throughout the industry).", "The first two points are legitimate complaints.  The last completely misses the point of the article, which is saying that if you want to eventually move up to the ranks of the highly paid, you need to have that blind faith and work hard even if you're being underpaid.\r\n\r\nLook at it from the POV of the employer.  If you're working hard and getting visible results, a raise is a no-brainer, because you have a proven track record that they don't want to lose to a competitor.  If you're *not* getting visible results, they have a dilemma.  They can continue to pay substandard wages for substandard work.  Or they can take a chance and give you a raise in the hopes that more money will elicit more effort.  If they take a chance and it works, everybody wins.  If they take a chance and it doesn't, they're out your raise with no return.  Moreover, seeing undeserving employees get promoted is *incredibly* demoralizing to people who do work hard.\r\n\r\nI don't know very many employers who will risk losing their good employees by gambling on their bad.  Interestingly, the major breaks in my life have been when organizations (s/employee/student|intern/) have done precisely that, gambling on me because they were startups anyway and didn't have much choice.  I'd like to think I paid them back; given that I'm an alumni of one and an employee of another, it seems like it.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, one way to \"avoid\" this chicken-and-egg scenario is to start your own business.  Then the market sets your pay and you're dependent upon no manager.  However, customers have the same reservations that managers do; they won't pay you fairly until *after* you have a track record, because they're afraid of getting screwed over.  So no matter what you do, you *still* have to have blind faith that the market will eventually fairly value your skills.", "I wish they'd actually done numbers on what proportions of those results overlap.

The &gt;&gt;= operator passes this RealWorld around and makes sure that it's never lost or duplicated.  All IO primitives have type IO a, which lets the compiler track their effects on the RealWorld, and there's no way to escape from the IO monad, which means you can't hide RealWorld effects from the rest of the program.", "&gt; But the factory will hire enough workers to meet production targets, even if this is more expensive.\r\n\r\nThis isn't necessarily true, because production targets change depending on costs.  A factory is not going to produce goods that it loses money on (barring special circumstances like loss-leaders or unexpected inventory glut, where it expects to make up the shortfall later on).  If its marginal profit becomes negative because of higher costs, it'll produce less and fire the excess workers.\r\n\r\nIf it becomes unprofitable for the factory to make the good at any price (quite possible, given capital and overhead costs), then the business will just close up, not produce everything, and *all* the workers will be out of a job.", "My favorite line was:\r\n\r\n&gt; she acknowledged that there was insurance money, but that her family didn't like the mother-in-law and hoped to use the cash to remodel their kitchen.\r\n\r\n(Later on, different family.)", "It makes me wonder what would happen when notoriously-uncompromising geeks meet the notoriously-uncompromising educational bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nSomehow I imagine the geek teacher doing all sorts of cool science experiments, being barred from doing so by the principal, and then doing all sorts of cool science experiments that involve blowing up effigies of said principal.\r\n\r\n(True story: one of the founder/teachers of my high school was a former entrepeneur who had sold a tech company for a few tens of millions.

Income curves for the bottom 4 quintiles are flat; the top quintile is rising steadily, the top 5% rising steeply.\r\n\r\nA more likely explanation: higher income brackets are speculating in real estate.  They're trading in and out of properties in hopes of a quick profit.  Family A buys a house in Boston for $425k, lives in it for two years, fixes it up, and sells it for $615k.  Family B buys a house in Kansas for $100k, fixes it up, and lives in it for 30 years.  Say 10% of homeowners are families like A; they will sell 10% * 50% = 5% of homes in a given year.  The remaining 90% will sell 90% * 3% = 3% of homes.  Families like A sell 60% more homes than families like B, so the median reflects their purchases.\r\n\r\n&gt; It seems hardly likely that the housing industry would spent much time producing massive numbers of houses that could not be bought.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what they're doing.  Or rather, they're producing massive numbers of houses that cannot be bought *at current prices*.  Don't you read the financial news?  The big story of late (well, besides commodities, inflation, and a softer U.S. dollar) is what'll happen when the housing bubble bursts and homebuilders will be forced to unload these properties.  In some hot real estate markets, only 5% of buyers can afford the median home, and inventory surpluses of thousands of homes are building up.\r\n\r\nPossibly interesting observation:\r\n\r\nSome of my classmates are graduating from college; taking high-paying jobs as State Department consultants, operations researchers, and financial software programmers; and then living with parents and saving essentially 100% of their incomes.  Then we wait for interest rates to rise, boomers to retire, banks to foreclose, and builders to unload their inventory, picking up the surplus housing at bargain-basement prices.

They serve the same purpose as investment in traditional Keynesian economics - by injecting outside demand, they add liquidity, which gets recycled through consumption, which spurs output, which makes everyone better off.  A low currency valuation is good here, because it encourages foreigners to buy your goods and spur demand.\r\n\r\nCutting wages would have no effect in this case, because it just concentrates wealth among capital owners, who have a low marginal propensity to consume and so don't do much to stimulate domestic demand.\r\n\r\nI have no idea which category Canada is in.

Think of what you're trying to do with your startup: unless you're a DJ, a nightclub owner, or a similar entertainment business, it probably involves none of these.\r\n\r\nAlso, chances are your college buddies have no skills that you don't have.  Come to think of it, chances are none of you have any skills at all coming out of college. ;-)\r\n\r\nA couple years of real-world experience gives you a chance to build up professional contacts and if you're lucky make some cross-discipline connections.  Don't ignore those marketing or legal folks.\r\n\r\n&gt; So what was your (everyone here's) excuse for not starting a startup?...\r\n\r\nWell, I got turned down from SFP and when the time came to actually *start* something, I felt I didn't have the experience and skills necessary to have a decent chance at success.  Ended up taking a job at someone else's startup instead, where I can see how real, profitable businesses work.\r\n\r\nProbably the biggest benefit of *not* starting straight out of college, I've found, is that you get a taste of what kind of problems people will actually pay money for you to solve.  The work we do is *much* more involved and ambitious than any of my prior projects.  You learn that yes, there are cases when databases are too slow; that all the algorithms &amp; data structure stuff you learn in college is *not* a waste of time; just because you have no idea how to do it does not mean it's impossible, nor let you off the hook for doing it if the customer wants it; and users do crazy things with your UI, and you better be able to accomodate them.  It's made me raise my sights significantly for what I'd want to accomplish with my own startup.  An AJAX front-end for a database app, where users can guess the schema, is *not* a defensible strategy.\r\n\r\nThis should be an \"Ask Reddit\" question. ;-)", "I thought about that as I wrote my comment.  It's an interesting perspective - raise wages, because that will get employers to fire workers, which leads them to increase capital investment to replace their workforce, which leads to increased efficiency.  Same argument as raising the gas tax, really: raise the gas tax, which will make driving increasingly painful, which will spur innovation in alternative energy, which over the long run will cost less than maintaining our gas consumption.\r\n\r\nAgain, I think it's important to be cautious though.  Domestic servants were eliminated because technology became cheaper, not because labor became more expensive.  The last time a major supply shock hit a critical factor of production (the OPEC embargoes in the 1970s), the outcome was uniformly bad for everyone.  Come to think of it, an oil shock like that is exactly something you'd expect to come out of corporate profits.  The biggest buyers of foreign oil are big corporate refineries, which have plenty of a profit cushion to absorb the higher prices.  But they just passed the cost increase along to customers, and ended up making *more* at the expense of everyman on the street.", "Depends on the company - some of the oil majors have fairly large investments in alternative energy sources.  [BP]() in particular is trying to \"greenify\" itself, with a large research effort in biofuels, and they even changed the company name to \"Beyond Petroleum\" to signify this.  ConocoPhillips also has fairly extensive alternative fuel research programs, and ChevronTexaco might too.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil's the big loser if we move to a sustainable economy: they not only have no alternative fuel program (to my knowledge), but they also have the biggest investment in denying the reality of global warming.", "I'd see Buffett more as \"[common sense]()\" than liberal.

And I don't see him supporting the more \"out there\" liberal policies like government handouts or political correctness.", "Huh?  This was in my high school science curriculum, some 8 years ago.

Thing is, if you fake something long enough, you're no longer faking it.  \"Green\" is at the top of BP's corporate values, and they totally and completely *indoctrinate* you with those values.  (My sister interned with them last summer, and she found this very offputting; BP, like many other large corporations, is akin to a cult.)  When you've spent 10-20 years saying \"green, green, green\" to your workforce, they're going to pick that up regardless of the core economics of your business.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, the Anglo-American majors are tiny compared to the state-owned oil companies.  I saw a spreadsheet with the reserves of all the majors on it, and Gazprom has about 10 times as much as ExxonMobil.  But the private companies tend to be more efficient at extracting oil, so they have disprortionate power based on their technical expertise.  Some of the state-owned majors (notably Venezuela) have been flexing their muscles recently though.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the *real* losers if we move to a sustainable economy are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and all the other major OPEC nations (many of which hate our guts).

For example, I consider the *inherent* goals to be:\r\n\r\n* Promote the production of goods and services that people will want, and distribute them to the people who want them.\r\n* Attempt to maximize the variety and availability of artistic and creative works\r\n\r\nMarkets and intellectual property laws are *instrumental* goals in pursuit of this.  I believe they are useful tools, but I also believe that when markets and property laws conflict with the above goals, it's the markets and laws that should change, not the goals.  I also don't believe that piracy is an extra-economic activity; most people who pirate music weigh the gain from having a large music collection against the risk and penalty if they get caught, and decide whether or not to download music based on that (possibly unconscious) calculation.  That's almost the definition of economic.  It's just not *monetary*.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps some support for my position in the [U.S. Constitution](): the copyright clause reads \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"  It is very explicit that the purpose of copyright is \"to promote the progress of Science and useful Arts\".  I could argue that there is plenty of evidence that the progress of science and useful arts is best promoted by the absence of copyright laws: take, for example, Linux/Apache/Perl/Mozilla/YouTube/MySpace/MP3.com/fanfiction.  \r\n\r\nI could also point to cases where people are *not* entitled to control their intellectual cases.  Take, for example, jokes.  When you tell a joke, you have no legal claim to prevent people from repeating it, nor can you prevent them from telling derivative jokes.  The same applies to oral stories, or anything not \"fixed in a tangible medium\".  It would also apply to improvised, unrecorded musical performances, even though those often require significantly more skill than the pop trite on the radio.\r\n\r\n(I'm not sure I'd go so far as to call downloading civil disobedience, though.  Civil disobedience usually implies that you are willing to take the consequences for disobeying the law.  I doubt many filesharers are happy about being sued.

In the US, it's a federal law that anyone who needs urgent care get treated right away as if they are a paying customer. It's one, but not *the* reason why it's expensive here. Urgent care is generally defined as emergency care or treatment for conditions that are life- or permanent-well-being-threatening if untreated. Beyond that, though, most hospitals follow a policy of treat first, bill later. The patient always has the option of refusing any and all treatment.\r\n\r\nAs for the apocryphal tales, they are indeed apocryphal. What's key to remember is that the insurer in these cases is refusing to *pay* for the treatment, not preventing the treatment from occurring. Generally it also happens for treatments that the medical community still considers \"experimental\", even if the efficacy has recently been proven (doctors like to see track records after treatment  before professional associations OK something as \"conventional\") and in these cases, you won't see statistics on the procedures, or if you do, they're privately maintained. There are plenty of private charities that raise money to pay medical bills for patients who cannot afford it or whose insurance will not cover. The Neely House in Boston, for example, provides patients and families with room and board at a quality-hotel-style building in downtown Boston, and the Neely Foundation provides money to pay for radical cancer treatments. Do people slip through the cracks? I'm sure they do. Is the US system perfect? Far from it. But I have yet to hear any convincing arguments that publicly-funded health care systems provide the same timely, quality and comprehensive care as private systems.", "Ah, the Harry Knowles of world military strikes again.\r\n\r\nFor one, he completely underestimates the design and operation of a modern carrier task force, and clearly ignores the roles of destroyers, subs and corvette-sized warships it contains. It is evidenced by his notion of fleet defense, implied when he talks about how a flotilla of little ships \"[drove] the Navy crazy trying to keep track of them. When the Admirals finally lost patience and ordered all planes and ships to leave, van Ripen had them all attack at once.\" My father, who did a tour as a line officer on a US cruiser in the 70's, said the CiC on his ship could track vessels as small as zodiac inflatabless from at least 70 miles away - he related one instance where nearby scavengers in small boats and trawlers were being tracked one by one outside a cordon area as they prepared a missile test. Newer radar systems can do an even better job than that.\r\n\r\nIt is not the primary job of fighter bombers launched from aircraft carriers to maintain fleet defense, so the notion of \"sending all the planes away\" as some terrible strategic maneuver is woefully overstated. Fighter bombers are launched to knock out other planes and strike at largely immobile surface targets on land and sea. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the implication that the US fleet is particularly vulnerable to anti-ship missiles is just an old canard. ASW has been around as long as the guided missile itself, given, yes, their relative ease to design. But outside the NATO arsenal, anti-ship missiles are notoriously unreliable. Added to that fact is the notion that the US Navy has had a stand-off strategy of destroying hostile targets before they are in range of missiles. Thinking the US fleet will wander  in littoral waters off Iran and just sit around flinging planes into the air is also laughably naive.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this guy's fanboy attempts to sound like a military expert are pretty entertaining.", "I reread the comment.

But the issue is, is it the government's role to provide it? I don't think so.

This can push smaller companies out of business and incur massive costs to the larger ones, who then (in my mind, justly) ask the government for some kind of recompense. A lot of the subsidies and sanctions the government doles out really are a type of horse trading, one that allows the government to impose the regulation it desires without literally destroying the industry.

This is why a master electrician gets more than an apprentice - there are more people at the apprentice skill level than that of the master level. The more there are, the less they get paid - this effect is enhanced when the jobs in question are jobs that do not have a time or materials factor. For example, most people can set the clock in their car without calling a mechanic because a) there's no special materials involved and b) you can do it rather quickly. If you need a new transmission, you tend to call a mechanic, unless you have a) the time, both to learn how (if need be) and execute it, and b) equipment such as specialized tools. But because there are a lot of people out there who can replace a transmission, they get paid less than the guys who actually designed the procedure that the mechanics follow, because there's less of them.\r\n\r\nI wish people would get off the notion that some nasty bad men want to make people poor, as if it would increase their share of this big fixed pile of money.

Quite possibly because an inequal amount of it has gathered in Aaron's head. Joking aside, I think there's a factor of diminishing returns in introspection where the act provides no benefit to the thinker. It's crucial that, as you suggest, people be aware of why they do things, if the things they do are consistent with their stated and implicit goals, and how these decisions affect others. But as those questions get answered (and indeed, new questions arisen to be answered), the questions get fewer and less important. Eventually you end up wondering precisely these things - \"should I focus all my efforts on being great at one thing, or be a master of many trades? Would pursuing the first course make me a specialist ad absurdium, or the latter, a dilettante?\" And the answer is as elusive as searching for the answer to \"is there a God?\" At least religious people know enough to avoid the question and take it on faith.\r\n\r\nI think too much introspection can be damaging, in lost opportunities to experience new things, make mistakes and learn from them, i.e. all the things that really do teach us about ourselves and the world. There's a saying in the Hagakure that \"one should make his decisions in the space of seven breaths\". Regardless of whether that's particularly enough time to decide certain things, the emphasis on making decisions after a limited amount of deliberations is very important. Often you don't have the evidence at the outset to tell you whether a particular choice is a good idea; you need to begin to make progress down the road to find out whether your choice was right. Introspection won't deliver you that evidence, you must find it, actively, out in the world.\r\n\r\nIn short: reflect on your actions and thoughts, but not longer than you need to understand them and make the choices that seem correct at the time.", "&gt;Look at what the Walton kids make a year for being lucky sperm recipients; then compare that to what an employee at Wal-Mart makes.\r\n\r\nCompared to what *everyone* was \"making\" 1000 years ago, you're an awfully lucky sperm recipient yourself.\r\n\r\n&gt;Now ask yourself: What makes such a system possible?\r\n\r\nA free market, where people can make such wealth out of a $1,000 loan.

So here's what happens: some guy mentions that he has a new daughter and someone else mentions that he should enjoy it. Stallman comes back and takes an uninvited swing at the guy for having the temerity to \"breed\". At this point nobody had said anything to Stallman about the superiority of \"breeding\" vs. emacs; Stallman opened that door all by himself. In so doing he stated, in essence, \"emacs is more important than your daughter\". And what people took offense at is not someone tearing down their \"religion\" of breeding, but of Stallman deigning to decide what should be more important to Stefan (or anyone). It would be the same if Stefan had said he was going to his daughter's dance recital, or his cousin's graduation, or anything else that might be more important to him than coding. \r\n\r\n&gt;You seem to dislike him, but you don't seem to have objective reasons.

Your posts read like \"Stallman is teh bomb\", ironically.\r\n\r\nBut since you raised the issue, I'll just out and say I think his ego writes checks his talent can't cash. Hurd is a prime example of that. Most of the grunt work on FSF projects are done by volunteers like Stefan Monnier and Luc Teirlinck, who do good work for free, all the while putting up with Stallman's ego and derogatory remarks. That he'd spend more energy trying to expropriate \"GNU\" Linux, simply because it was written with GNU tools and has some libraries, as opposed to actually developing the free kernel he's been touting for decades, underscores my point that he is more style than substance (and given his style, that's not saying much).\r\n\r\nAs for **subjective** reasons, I'll just say he's a self-important jerk who swaddles himself in the mantle of software for altruism, when it suits him.

The premise of atheism is founded on the skepticsm of claims that have no basis in evidence. On the other hand, religion forces people into accepting dogma without ever questioning it. This leads to groupthink and intolerance and it's the main reason why atheists no longer see fundamentalists as merely harmless lunatics. The potential for harm is just too great for us to ignore religious zealotry.\r\n\r\n&gt; There are many good people among strong religious believers but they still support a structure that is inherently evil because it promotes doctrine over rational thought and blind faith over factual evidence. The time has come for atheists to stop tiptoeing around the very real dangers that organized religions pose to the civilized world.\r\n\r\nWhat? I think you are confusing instances of a concept (e.g. fundamentalism) for the concept itself (religion). Groupthink and intolerance are not by-products of religion they are caused by simple human nature. A lot of religions consider rational thought and questioning to be a necessary part of the practice. Things are not as simple as atheism=logic, religion=fiction.

Really, I would. However, having lived through another grand scam, I'm not so sure.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980's LP's got replaced by CD's. Prices more or less doubled.

I seem to recall that the payback was about equal to being reimbursed for 2 cd's of 'overcharge.' Hmmm.

If someone was beating me, I'd defend myself up to the point that I was reasonably safe. In this case, there is no ambiguity about who is doing what - who is attacking, who to strike back against, and so on. Would I turn my other cheek to an insult? Most of the time, yes. I'm just as prideful and hypocritical as anyone else, though, so I'd have to see. It's been a long time (excepting usenet/reddit discussions) that anyone has insulted me to my face - I'm priveleged to live in a civil society.\r\n\r\nWhen a group takes a prisoner, or kills an individual soldier, striking out at an entire culture, especially through attacks on groups that demonstrably include children, is not equivalent to self defence. It is vengeance. It is revenge. It is retaliation. It is not the same thing as defending yourself against an individual. It is the equivalent of me tracking down someone who punched me, five years later, and blowing up their house with their kids in it. \r\n\r\nIf Israel, say, went into the building where the soldier was being held and killed the people holding him - the _ADULTS_ holding him - I'd say 'justifiable.' But that isn't what has been going on in the middle east for the last few decades.\r\n\r\nIf a large group - say, a country - does not 'turn the other cheek' (or, in the terms that have been used in the African inquests in the last few years, engage in 'truth and reconciliation' rather than revenge) then all it takes is a very small minority of ruthless and perhaps ideological extremists on either side to hold the entire culture hostage. The average people are constantly shown examples of their own kind being hurt, and they become increasingly bitter and more likely to join the extremists.\r\n\r\nWhat it takes for this to stop is for one group to say \"we feel wronged, but we know that what happened is not representative about what the average member of _your_ culture would _do_\". (even if we know that the average member of your culture is smug about what happened).\r\n\r\nSo when I implied Israel may need to turn the other cheek, it was in this sense.\r\n\r\nNote that I have not said that they shouldn't defend themselves. For example, to shoot at people with guns when under attack. Or that they shouldn't use rubber bullets on people throwing stones at their troops.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, in this context, I am motivated by a belief that this kind of strategy 'damps down' rather than 'fans the flames of' violence.\r\n\r\nBTW, I was raised Anglican.

Very nice. The fact that you can point out that the semantics of 'greenhouse gas' can be confusing isn't helpful in that it implies that we shold focus on H2O - which we don't significant affect - and so say that CO2 is not a big issue - which it may be. Certainly H2O is part of the model. Just like, as I said, the fact that our bodies are part water is relevant to the discussion of being alive, which is relevant to the discussion of being intelligent. That doesn't make H2O a causative factor in intelligence, no more than it makes H2O something we should use as a smokescreen to cover up anthropogenic change. Perhaps I'm nitpicking here, I've been guilty of that in the past :&lt;)\r\n\r\nWhy is it inconvenient that CO2 is logarithmic? This is the point. Anything we do is in the short term going to be a bigger effect than it would otherwise be.

In the case of socialism, individuals are given power to control an entire economy, and they often still act in their own self interests -- but even if they try to help people, they lack the price information necessary to do so.  In the case of corporatism, companies are allowed to buy control over the economy, so the results are similar to socialism, it just takes longer.  This is what's happening in the US right now.  Government power always goes to the highest bidder in a corporatist society, while in a socialist society, it always goes to the most charming people's hero and his/her friends.\r\n\r\n&gt; But in large scale industrial projects, social administration at the board of directors/executive level doesn't imply an innability to promote innovation or use 3rd party vendors that can provide it.\r\n\r\nIt does if you follow the money.

My CS professors couldn't program their way out of a paper bag.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was to get your attention, but it's often the case and not just exaggeration.  Computer Science (which of course isn't a science) has more to do with theory.  Of course there is overlap between CS and programming but CS != programming.  I also find the notion that everyone needs to physically go to a classroom, hauling paper books and listening to a human SPEAK information in order to learn to be laughable.\r\n\r\nYou can read information more quickly than you can hear someone talk about it, and you can skip reading the sections you already know.  Having online reference makes a lot more sense than flipping through a hardcover book as well.  Not to mention, the only way you are going to get good at programming is by doing it, JUST like art -- going to art school lectures does not make you an better artist.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn CS proper, you can get the same textbooks that are used to teach the subject and learn it yourself.  Most teachers don't have time in lecture to cover all the material so you have to do this anyway even if you go to a university.  \r\n\r\nA substantial amount of CS is practicable, just like a good chunk of mathematics is used for physics; and to give one example familiar to many, \"theoretical\" constructs like imaginary numbers turn out to be useful for actual circuits.  So there's an ever-growing amount of theory that finds applications, but there is still a big difference between math and physics, similar to CS and programming.\r\n\r\nVarious minor subjects like recursion and big-O function magnitude do not require a large investment of time -- which is probably why they are taught in introductory CS courses.    Anyone interested in programming is going to find ongoing education essential, but this has nothing to do with CS per se or having a degree.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, CS degrees can be completed with widely varying coursework, with an emphasis on different subsets of the field.  If you want to hire someone to do a specific task, you need to find someone with the necessary skills -- and a degree in CS versus CE versus Philosophy versus no degree does not tell you if the person has the skills you want.  It doesn't matter what it \"generally\" tells you since you aren't hiring for a \"general\" position, but rather something specific, and thus need to look at *individuals*.\r\n\r\nOf course you usually can't hire the best programmers anyway because they are working for themselves or otherwise on a project that is more interesting than your ASP.NET migration contract.  \r\n", "When I was little, comic books depicted the heroes as the ones who held the moral high ground because they didn't take the view of the end justifying the means.  A lot of times it would be easier for them to just take the law into their own hands, to disregard the rights of others, but then they would be no better than the villains they were trying to stop.\r\n\r\nThe thing that made the U.S. different was that we stood up for human rights.  If someone was accused of a crime, we didn't say \"he doesn't deserve fair treatment because he wouldn't be fair to us\".  We showed we were in the right by extending rights to others, that we could prove charges against criminals before sentencing them.  I always thought it was backwards that in some countries you have to prove your INNOCENCE and were presumed guilty just because you were accused.\r\n\r\nNow the U.S. is in the business of indefinitely imprisoning people without any charges and without any chance for a trial, and torturing them, sometimes to death.

The following comes from a [BBC article]():\r\n\r\n&gt;Ninety-five percent of the United States' fresh water is underground. As farmers in the Texan High Plains pump groundwater faster than rain replenishes it, the water tables are dropping. North America's largest aquifer, the Ogallala, is being depleted at a rate of 12 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year. Total depletion to date amounts to some 325 bcm, a volume equal to the annual flow of 18 Colorado Rivers. The Ogallala stretches from Texas to South Dakota, and waters one fifth of US irrigated land. Many farmers in the High Plains are now turning away from irrigated agriculture, as they become aware of the hazards of overpumping, and realise water is not in endless supply.\r\n\r\nCombine the three things that seem inevitable: a forced move away from a cheap energy society, a long term (perhaps permanent) chronic water shortage, and global warming.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that I think it is very prudent to question whether we should continue to expand our population or should we pause until we have solutions to problems that currently appear to be inescapable.", "A similar thing happened to the Confederate [Battle Flag]() and [Navy Jack]().

Shareholders' stock investments are liquid, i.e. they can all find buyers for their stock at current market prices (in practical terms, this might be a problem, but it isn't for the analogy with the U.S. government)\r\n2. The debt was not so unevenly distributed that a majority of shareholders would vote to default at the expense of a minority of large debtholders.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because if the company goes bankrupt, the company's stock is worth $0 (other debtholders have prior claim on a company's assets).  If the company does not go bankrupt, then their stock is worth more than their debt (by #1).  Therefore, they would opt to forgive their own company bonds in order to preserve their stock investment.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to social security.

The GAAP figures are probably more accurate here.\r\n* The $3.5T figure in the headline is arrived at by adding in the federal debt borrowed from other agencies (specifically, the social security trust fund).  This is more dubious.  The government *will* have to pay this money back - assuming social security is still intact in 10 years.  However, if it pays it back, social security is in nowhere near as dire shape as the pundits have made it out (it remains solvent until 2041 at the earliest).  Basically, *either* social security is in trouble, or we're borrowing way too much.  The numbers don't support a fiscally healthy federal government *and* social security, but similarly they don't support both a fiscal collapse and a social security crisis.\r\n* The $49.4T negative net worth reflects unfunded social security liabilities out to 2075 (the situation is more dire the longer out you go, because under current demographic trends expenditures will continue to outpace income by about 1% of GDP, for the indefinite future).  Again, if social security goes away, so does the remaining $40T or so.  Even a small tweak (by cutting benefits or raising the retirement age) may be enough to significantly reduce this liability.\r\n* If you're under 40 and depending on social security to fund your retirement, you're an idiot (okay, I couldn't resist slipping an opinion in).\r\n* There are many options besides hyperinflation that could get the government off the hook.  The most obvious one is to adjust social security taxes and benefits so that they balance.  This would wipe off that unfunded $40T liability and also the $5T or so of government debt currently held by social security.  Aside from that, we could also raise taxes and stop getting involved in foreign wars (or at least find allies to pay for them).\r\n* 80% of the federal budget - and 300% of the GAAP budget *deficit* - comes from 5 departments: Defense, Social Security Agency, Health &amp; Human Services, VA, and interest payments.

Evolution is not a process, it is a historical fact (biological organisms change over time). *Natural Selection* (mutations that are adaptive to an environment result in a more successful organism) is a process, and it is not exactly random or unguided, it is simply defined in terms of fitness for an ecological system.\r\n\r\n&gt; Evolution claims that the most \"created-looking\" things around us, living systems, came about by a process that is the antithesis of creation.\r\n\r\nHow is subtle change over time the antithesis of creation? Most music, art, and writing goes through this process, and they are widely deemed as creative processes. Have watches/books/cars/houses/computers not subtley changed over time? As concepts they have evolved, and even their design was subject to change before they were manufactured.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, the fact that something can *look* like it was created according to a plan does not mean that it was. Living systems appear orderly because competition for scarce resources ensures that only adaptive organisms survive. Because other organisms are part of the system in which they live just about any biological organism will evolve to interact with other biological organisms. Over time this kind of change generates a highly codependent ecosystem that appears to be so complex it could only be planned that way. That appearance does not constitute truth.\r\n\r\n&gt; Common sense and common experience are on the creation side of the debate.\r\n\r\nI see no reason to believe that statement. Especially considering common sense involves using logic and all powerful creators usually exist outside the bounds of logical understanding.\r\n\r\n&gt; It may be hard to believe in an intelligent Creator who is undetectable by scientific means. Yet our knowledge of the difficulty of building \"created-looking\" things even with the help of intelligent designers, makes the alternative even harder to believe.\r\n\r\nI highly encourage you to look into [Genetic Programming]() it uses evolutionary algorithms to create computer programs.", "The Texas construction business is not a particularly great example.

A shovel doesn't just appear you make it, you build that capital and own it and can then sell it.  Maybe you are thinking about resources like oil, at some level you have to allow companies to in effect \"own\" the production rights.  That doesn't mean the state shouldn't negotiate the best possible price.  Both canada and alaska make billions off the oil they have, as well they should.

We need a different solution.\r\n\r\n&gt; I would also take issue with your point that abstinence engenders jumping the gun in marriage, and in doing so causes marriages to fail. Hand in hand with this rationale for abstinence goes a proper understanding of what marriage is, and it's impact.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that's the intention, but when it comes to things like marriage and relationships, no amount of education can make up for simple experience and maturity.\r\n\r\n&gt; A proper reverence for the sanctity and permanence of the covenant.\r\n\r\nMuch lip service is paid to this, but ironically I think it's the other side that *truly* shows proper respect for the sanctity and permanence of marriage by not allowing it to become the only acceptable path to sex.\r\n\r\n&gt; To enter into that because you want to have sex with someone is foolish.\r\n\r\nOf coure it is! But it's going to happen anyway when you tell young people that marriage is the only way to have sex.

I'll admit that I'm not a Christian or a religious scholar, but from what I understand about Christian philosophy, it seems like social liberalism (from a legal perspective) is actually more in line with the tenets of Christianity than social conservatism is. After all, free will and individual responsibility are at the very core of Christian morality. That means that people are given the ability to make decisions for themselves and are completely responsible for the consequences of those decisions. Well, how can that principle be fairly applied if legal force, to any degree, is used to try and push people in the \"right\" direction? How can you be sure that a person is truly being a \"good\" Christian (or, for that matter, how can they be sure themselves) if the law encourages them to be so, or discourages them from not being so? Are they following their own moral judgement, or just taking the path of least resistance? For that matter, how can a person come to a truly mature understanding of right and wrong if they are not given the freedom to make some bad decisions in their life? You show me someone who has never done something stupid, never hurt themselves or another person through their own ignorance or selfishness, and I'll show you someone who barely knows what it is to be a responsible adult.\r\n\r\nObviously there are other considerations. A person's actions should not intrude on the freedom or safety of others, and the law should intervene in such cases. But beyond that, individual freedom means the freedom to make your own right and wrong decisions and learn from them.

They found that if you have a holstered gun, someone with a knife within 15 feet can probably close and stab you, possibly to death, even if you manage to eventually shoot him.  He has a good chance to grapple with you and prevent you from even drawing your gun, being that he can cut you as you both struggle.\r\n\r\nI know movies always show superficial line cuts from knives but in reality getting stabbed is an effective way to die.

I have two problems with this. First, you meet the classic self-referential set (from Cantor, I think) paradox: Does the set of all sets which don't contain themselves, contain itself? Richard's is just an example of this paradox, since by saying how the diagonalization is made, *he describes the number*! (imagine it's in French) Therefor, the diagonalization has failed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the problem of listing all the numbers that a language can express in any case, and whether diagonalization applies. Imagine I write \"The number represented by the ratio of ideal circle's circumference to its radius, and by the way, ignore anything after this period. LALALALA\".

As soon as *any number* is used in a mathematical statement, it is defined, and therefor \"nameable\".

But now we are faced with a new shortage that taps another precious resource. Water only comes through the tap fours hours a day and we are forced to pay ten to hundred times what we paid in the 90s. Welcome to the world of privatized water, where fresh water is treated like a commodity, traded and sold in the international market to the highest bidder. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;No longer can you assume a God-given right to drink from a mountain spring, but instead you will have to pay a toll to drink from Enron Springs, Monsanto Wells or receive tap water from Bechtel Water Works. Global consumption of water is doubling every 20 years, more than twice the rate of human population growth. According to the United Nations, more than one billion people already lack access to fresh drinking water. If current trends persist, by 2025 the demand for fresh water is expected to rise by 56 percent more than the amount of water that is currently available. Multinational corporations recognize these trends and are trying to monopolize water supplies around the world. Monsanto, Bechtel, Enron and other global multinationals are seeking control of world water systems and supplies. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The World Bank recently adopted a policy of water privatization and full-cost water pricing. This policy is causing great distress in many Third World countries, which fear that their citizens will not be able to afford for-profit water. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Last year in a little known case of high scale international water marketing, a supertanker was reported to have filled up with water from Lake Erie and after paying the Canadian Government they shipped the water to Southeast Asia. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Maude Barlow, chair of the Council of Canadians, Canada's largest public advocacy group, states, \"Governments around the world must act now to declare water a fundamental human right and prevent efforts to privatize, export, and sell for profit a substance essential to all life. Research has shown that selling water on the open market only delivers it to wealthy cities and individuals. The finite sources of freshwater (less than one half of one per cent of the world's total water stock) are being diverted, depleted, and polluted so fast that, by the year 2025, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in a state of serious water deprivation.\" \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Governments are signing away their control over domestic water supplies by participating in trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and in institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). These agreements give transnational corporations the unprecedented right to the water of signatory ! compan ies. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Monsanto plans to earn revenues of $420 million and a net income of $63 million by 2008 from its water business in India and Mexico. Monsanto estimates that water will become a multibillion-dollar market in the coming decades. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;This international water crisis news story was selected by over 150 faculty and student researchers at Sonoma State University's Project Censored in California as the number one most censored news story for 2000.\r\n\r\nThat is just one article of dozens that are easily found when investigating water.

It largely depends on whether Peak Oil is correct as a theory and whether we decide to build breeder reactors soon enough (it takes a lot of fossil fuel to build a reactor).\r\n\r\nIf half of all available oil reserves have been pumped out, then we had better invent an alternative and get it implemented ASAP.  This is because it is likely to take a lot of energy to build the new system; energy we won't have unless we act on an appropriate schedule.\r\n\r\nOur demand for oil has doubled every ~20 years since we started using the stuff and that means, once we reach the half-way mark, we will have ~20 years of oil left.  Sure, prices will skyrocket as the supply dwindles but oil you can't afford is oil you don't have so it might as well not exist.\r\n\r\nThe water problem is not likely to be as easy to solve.  It's not a matter of having water as we have literally oceans of the stuff, it's a matter of having usable water.\r\n\r\nFor example, the [Ogallala aquifer]() is being depleted.

(2) What resource will be involved? and (3) How critical/irreplaceable will that resource be?\r\n\r\nHowever, the impending crisis that has me most concerned isn't a \"peak crisis\" as water does go through a cycle.  However, the water cycle takes time and for at least the past 30 years the western states and Florida have been consuming water faster than the water cycle can replenish it.  As our population grows this problem is spreading to the other states.  Water is an absolutely critical resource not only for drinking but for agriculture and industry.  There is no alternative.\r\n\r\nWe know the shortage of water in America is a hard fact as the level of water table in western states has dropped consistently and the quality of Florida water has fallen due to the intrusion of brackish water into the aquifers.\r\n\r\nThe water problem is much worse in Mexico.  A quick search of Google reveals [many articles on the subject](;q=mexico+water+crisis).  The Mexican government is well aware of this issue as they [have been violating our water treaty with them](;lr=&amp;q=mexico+water+treaty) and exporting their surplus population (immigrants that are valuable to us should be valuable in Mexico too now that NAFTA lets the job go to the worker).\r\n\r\nCombine the disaster that would come about from one or more peak crises with global warming and a massive water shortage then it doesn't seem at all prudent to be increasing the population of America.", "As a matter of fact, my opinion is not completely uninformed.

From a site promoting the [The Obesity Europe Conference](;type=current)\r\n\r\n&gt; It is reported that almost a third of all people living in Europe are overweight, and although awareness of the problem is rising, it is still the case that excluding Portugal, over 50% of people living within each EU member state are failing to meet at least 3 of the 4 diet and health targets set by the World Health Organisation. And it is not just adults that are affected - according to a study carried out in 2003 by the London-based International Obesity TaskForce, of the 77 million children living in the European Union, 14 million are overweight. This figure, given current trends, is set to rise sharply by 400,000 each year.\r\n\r\nI remember when I lived in England in the 1960s.

I.e., the prisoners are engaging in warfare.\r\n\r\nBy \"asymmetrical\" he means \"What are we supposed to be able to do about it?\".  If the prisoners are denied the items they used to hang themselves (i.e., sheets and clothes) it will be viewed as abuse.  If the prisoners are watched 24x7 then it will be viewed as psychological abuse.  No matter how the prisoners are handled they can work out a way to \"win\".\r\n\r\nAmerica is really screwed in this conflict because the jihadists will do absolutely anything to win and do not care what the world thinks of them at all.  Only what they think Allah will think of them matters.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, America has neighbors it would like to continue to talk to after all of this is over and therefore needs to at least think about its reputation a little (I know some people will reply America's reputation is already shot).\r\n\r\nAs a result, America can either retreat which will be another Vietnam-style catastrophe in that it will teach every wanna-be anti-America yutz that we have no willpower and should be provoked whenever possible.  Or, we can fight the war to win militarily which will mean ignoring various human rights issues and doing whatever it takes to win.\r\n\r\nEither way, America loses.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the first world really ought to hope America chooses the second path and wins the war militarily.

That's because there was a bigger threat to the region in Iran which had just had a violent revolution and was being run by a religious nut.\r\n\r\nLater, when the Shiites in southern Iraq started the rebellion and we could have aided them against Saddam we chose not to because the result would have been an Iraq very sympathetic to Iran who are also Shiites (89 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslim).\r\n\r\nChomsky says America just let Saddam do all these things and we forgot about it.

The fact she was or claimed to be a social democrat makes her a traitor in my mind. Therefore I may not be impartial about this, although I think my point stands well.\r\n\r\nAbout the precedent issue. It appears that the minister has discretional powers on this matter (discretional means, roughly, that within the legal alternatives any can be chosen). For whatever reason (above there's probably the reason why) the minister has chosen to act in a very restrictive way.

Continental law systems try to minimize reliance on precedent because it goes counter to juridical security. You shouldn't need to go to court to know what a law means, you should merely have to read it with the right knowledge about the legal system. I'm somewhat opposed to leaving too much discretionary power to judges of administrators, because people don't know what to expect, but the counterpart of this is that laws should be interpreted carefully and close to the text, meaning and purpose. It's a difficult question whether flexibility (by letting judges or administrators make more choices) or security (by making laws more binding) is to be preferred.

The intellectual property industry (am lumping software/movie/music/ebooks together because they're economically the same) is just the limiting case of an industry with high fixed costs and low marginal costs.  There are many other instances of similar industries:\r\n\r\n1. Roads/downloadable software/music/movies - it costs a lot of money to build a road, but then anyone can drive on it at no additional cost to the producer.\r\n2. Railroads/airlines/fiberoptics(? - may be category #1) - it costs a lot of money to build the infrastructure, anyone can ride on it at minimal/no additional cost to the producer, but there is a limited capacity beyond which large capital investments are required.\r\n3. Electricity/Telecom/Oil/Internet software/Shrinkwrapped software - there is a hefty initial capital investment, but then the marginal cost is extremely low (non-zero) for each additional unit\r\n\r\nThen there are 3 recurring outcomes which these situations always end up in.\r\n\r\n1. Public good, available to all.  Roads are built by the government and generally free for use.  Downloadable software is almost all open-source now: it's very difficult to make a living on it, unless you're serving a small niche.  Music &amp; movies are widely pirated.\r\n2. Cyclical boom/bust.  The railroads and airlines have *always* had profit problems - the airline industry has lost more money than it's made over its history.  This is because the high marginal returns after the initial capital investment attract competitors, which results in massive overcapacity, which sends the price through the floor, which wipes out large segments of the industry at a time.  Then the cycle repeats.\r\n3. Monopoly.  Either a regulated one (utilities) or an unregulated one (Standard Oil/AT&amp;T/Microsoft/soon Google).  Note that this has nothing to do with the company's evil world domination plans; it seems to be inherent in the industry.  Standard Oil was broken up, and now it's getting back together again, with the bulk of the U.S. oil industry in ExxonMobil/ChevronTexaco/ConocoPhillips.  AT&amp;T was broken up, and now it's getting back together again, through Verizon/SBC/AT&amp;T/whatever.\r\n\r\nThis is not about market circumvention; it's an inherent part of the structure of the market.  The difference is that until recently the music &amp; movie industries had large capital costs and small distribution costs, the situation leading to monopoly or cartel.  Now they have large capital costs and no distribution costs, a situation leading to public good or commoditization (a la open-source).  The problem is that the industry's self-perception is still stuck where it was 10 years ago, at odds with the economic reality.\r\n\r\nEven if they stamp out piracy entirely, the music industry is doomed.

He mostly does, only going so far as to describe Joan of Arc's \"insane coolness\" (after a while, even the French would take issue with that - Burgundians capturing her and selling her to the English), while expecting his ill-informed readers to overlook the French catastrophe of Agincourt, itself a reminant of the battle of Poitiers in which the Black Prince was able to capture the French King John II, who was later ransomed, but not before the English gained control of the Aquitane.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are plenty of French victories in the Hundred Years' War too - my point is not to prove France was weak, but that the argument they are the greatest military power of the past thousand years to be hyperbole at best.", "Probably the experts I trust the most, when it comes to the global warming issue, are the ones who said \"the study of global climate change is an 'emerging science,' one that is perhaps the most complex ever tackled.

Mention that you have no insurance and most doctors will be happy to plan treatment according to your financial needs. Often times doctors take a certain path (for example, ordering an expensive MRI vs. a barium X-Ray to diagnose a bone fracture) simply because it's become standard procedure to order a better test even if the benefit is marginal. My doctor constantly prescribes generic drugs even though I have the option, under my health plan, to get the name-brands.\r\n\r\nIf you talk to people, and don't go through life assuming your limited experience is all there is to know on a subject, you'll find a wonderful amount of new information you never knew existed.", "Fair.

Couple that with the fact that $40k this year is worth 96% of what it was last year and your real income is even less. There's no fuzzy math involved. This is actually how taxation used to work until it was tied to the inflation rate. My parents saw their real income drop almost 10% as a result of it.

Implicit in that is that you critically examined some aspects of said faith and found them lacking. It seems fitting to assume that the moral teachings of the faith were held under scrutiny. So I would argue that most atheists, in America, have experience to a lesser or greater extent with two moral systems: those of their \"original religion\" and whatever new concepts they have developed.\r\n\r\nLooking back and deciding so much of what you knew before was wrong tends to force you into examining everything else you know.

By the nature of the system children who are educated at home recieve that education from a self-selecting group of parents who are in some fashion more concerned with the education of their children. The success of these individuals could also be attributed to the extra effort their parents took in helping their education, and that same effort applied to a child who went through a more traditional education system could produce the same results.\r\n\r\nedit: Cleaned up some phrases in an effort to make some sense.", "My opposition to this test is at the other end of knowledge on the subject.

If you have a fully functional grid class (with only one grid class, what other kind would you have?) out of which you only want to use a few features (same features and used repeatedly) it does not make sense to go through the full class instantiation process each time; instead make a subclass that does all of the busywork and sends on the relevant details. I guess for cases when subclassing is relatively equivalent to currying it makes sense.\r\n\r\nAnyways, awesome that you found motivation for you project. In the end the real test is if it works.

Kids should be learning faster if they can, kids who do not learn quickly should not advance until they get it.
