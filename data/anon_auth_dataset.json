Its buildup is what makes your muscles tire and give out.\r\n\r\nOnly when over your lactate threshold.\r\n\r\n&gt;Coaches and personal trainers tell athletes and exercisers that they have to learn to work out at just below their \"lactic threshold,\" that point of diminishing returns when lactic acid starts to accumulate.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever said to only work out below your lactate threshold. You do spend 80+% of your time doing base cardio though, which is below threshold.\r\n\r\n&gt;But that, it turns out, is all wrong. \r\n\r\nNo it's not.\r\n\r\n&gt;Lactic acid is actually a fuel, not a caustic waste product.\r\n\r\nIt's both.\r\n\r\n&gt;Muscles make it deliberately, producing it from glucose, and they burn it to obtain energy. \r\n\r\nThey only produce it when deprived of oxygen.\r\n\r\n&gt;The reason trained athletes can perform so hard and so long is because their intense training causes their muscles to adapt so they more readily and efficiently absorb lactic acid.\r\n\r\nNot true. Maximum power comes from the creatine-phosphate system. Maximum endurance comes from the aerobic system. The anaerobic system is used when you are multiple lifts or when you are exceeding your cardio threshold in a distance piece.  Having good cardio is necessary so that you avoid going over your lactate threshold as long as possible; only when you are unavoidably over threshold does the anaerobic system kick in as a stoploss measure.\r\n\r\n&gt;Lack of oxygen to muscles leads to lactic acid, leads to fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt does.\r\n\r\n&gt;Athletes were told that they should spend most of their effort exercising aerobically, using glucose as a fuel.\r\n\r\nThey should.\r\n\r\n&gt;If they tried to spend too much time exercising harder, in the anaerobic zone, they were told, they would pay a price, that lactic acid would accumulate in the muscles, forcing them to stop.\r\n\r\nThis is true.\r\n\r\n&gt;It looked as if lactic acid was there for a reason. It was a source of energy.\r\n\r\nThis is true, but doesn't overturn the previous claims.\r\n\r\n&gt;Through trial and error, coaches learned that athletic performance improved when athletes worked on endurance, running longer and longer distances, for example. That, it turns out, increased the mass of their muscle mitochondria, letting them burn more lactic acid and allowing the muscles to work harder and longer.\r\n\r\nThis might technically be true, I don't know. But even if it is true, it's a poor explanation. Doing cardio increases the amount of lactate you can absorb before going over your lactate threshold. It does this by increasing the amount of oxygen your muscles can utilize.\r\n\r\n&gt;Yet, Dr. Brooks said, even though coaches often believed in the myth of the lactic acid threshold, they ended up training athletes in the best way possible to increase their mitochondria.\r\n\r\nNowhere does the article say what is wrong with the lactate threshold and why they call it a myth.\r\n\r\nThe entire article is both misleading and filled with factual errors.", "Chris Sacca said this a couple week ago at Startup School and it's been bouncing around my head ever since.

This is why we create a myth called money that we place value on.\r\n\r\nSame thing with energy. There is unlimited energy for us to use, the problem is that we don't have the incentives to tap into this unlimited energy unless we pretend that energy is scarce and limited.

I still think there is a corresponding vicous circle of 'well, they attacked _us_' going on. I also still think that attacking a populace that has a small minority of extremists in it isn't the same thing as 'directing violence back at the militant Anglicans' because you kill a lot of people that weren't involved, and thus tend to create more extremists. As I said, I have no problem whatsoever with fighting extremists. But blowing up innocents.... because they are standing beside someone else, or driving by, or having a day on the wrong beach, or...

I'm just as prideful and hypocritical as anyone else, though, so I'd have to see. It's been a long time (excepting usenet/reddit discussions) that anyone has insulted me to my face - I'm priveleged to live in a civil society.\r\n\r\nWhen a group takes a prisoner, or kills an individual soldier, striking out at an entire culture, especially through attacks on groups that demonstrably include children, is not equivalent to self defence. It is vengeance. It is revenge. It is retaliation. It is not the same thing as defending yourself against an individual. It is the equivalent of me tracking down someone who punched me, five years later, and blowing up their house with their kids in it. \r\n\r\nIf Israel, say, went into the building where the soldier was being held and killed the people holding him - the _ADULTS_ holding him - I'd say 'justifiable.' But that isn't what has been going on in the middle east for the last few decades.\r\n\r\nIf a large group - say, a country - does not 'turn the other cheek' (or, in the terms that have been used in the African inquests in the last few years, engage in 'truth and reconciliation' rather than revenge) then all it takes is a very small minority of ruthless and perhaps ideological extremists on either side to hold the entire culture hostage. The average people are constantly shown examples of their own kind being hurt, and they become increasingly bitter and more likely to join the extremists.\r\n\r\nWhat it takes for this to stop is for one group to say \"we feel wronged, but we know that what happened is not representative about what the average member of _your_ culture would _do_\".

However, having 'everyone gets a vote' won't work either. Just look at how Walmart has managed to subvert Wikipedia's commentary about... Walmart.\r\n\r\nAs for the outright lies.\r\n\r\nThe article says that people who referee papers are amateurs with no accountability. Horseshit. I've been a professional academic for (depending on whether you count grad work or not) between a decade and 20 years. I am a referree, quite regularly, and on grants committee's. The whole process is very involved but essentially at every point you have to point out conflict of interest and leave the room for decisions that are either of benefit to you or relate to direct competitors (within reason). \r\n\r\nYes, there are biases. The process is biased towards the status quo. But zero accountability? No way. If you give off-the-cuff reviews then the metareviewers remove you from the pool. Sure, you can find exceptions to this- superpowerful big name researchers for example - but for the most part the process is watchers-who-watch and quite fair. I have been the 'metareviewer' (usually called a third opinion, because most papers are reviewed by two people) a number of times and it is not fun, because you are both reviewing the paper and implicitly reviewing the reviewers (the editor wouldn't call you in if there wasn't a big discrepancy between reviews).\r\n\r\nIn my experience most papers are crap in some way. Badly written, shoddy background research / literature review, crappy experimental method, over the top 'consequences' and so on. Many are essentially undergraduate or MSc research projects that taught the student a lot but shouldn't inflate the already crazy amount of published material. And of course, people who get rejections get annoyed.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear hierarchy of journals - in the sciences, 'Science' and 'Nature' are at the top. Some people will fire a paper higher than it deserves and resubmit down the chain until it ends up in some mediocre journal somewhere. Some people flame the reviewers and have a tantrum. Some people improve their writing and research and stop submitting half-assed stuff and eventually start getting published.\r\n\r\nIMHO the big problem is that academics are expected to publish an 'above-average' number of papers. Can you say runaway inflation? I'd say the average academic can manage one credible first-authored paper a year (yes, there are exceptions in fields where you can, for example, name a new mineral, but those are rarely full papers). Some years you can manage two. Beyond that either quality goes down or it was really written by a grad student, who SHOULD have been given first authorship.\r\n\r\nJournals would be better if referees were MORE critical. I spend HOURS wading through shit papers looking for the 1% that are worth reading. I'd rather editors and reviewers and authors reduced the fluff and crap to say 50%. Wow, that would be great. Not bloody likely though since 'number of papers' is easy to evaluate and 'quality' is bloody hard. \r\n\r\nThe day we go to a 'reddit' or 'slashdot' style science publishing system is the day that groups like the churches or large corporations can subvert the system. Yes, the system is somewhat broken. Yes, there are abuses of power. No, it isn't just amateurs... it is people who've spent years 'in the trade.' And YES, that means there is a certain circularity to how decisions are made, and that  means many REALLY REVOLUTIONARY papers are rejected because they are outside the scope of what reviewers will consider.\r\n\r\n", "Ha ha. Very nice. The fact that you can point out that the semantics of 'greenhouse gas' can be confusing isn't helpful in that it implies that we shold focus on H2O - which we don't significant affect - and so say that CO2 is not a big issue - which it may be. Certainly H2O is part of the model. Just like, as I said, the fact that our bodies are part water is relevant to the discussion of being alive, which is relevant to the discussion of being intelligent. That doesn't make H2O a causative factor in intelligence, no more than it makes H2O something we should use as a smokescreen to cover up anthropogenic change. Perhaps I'm nitpicking here, I've been guilty of that in the past :&lt;)\r\n\r\nWhy is it inconvenient that CO2 is logarithmic? This is the point.

But some decisions will be ever-so-slightly better (perhaps you've heard that a friend sent his son to school X, and the boy ended up working at NASA), and that gives it a decisive advantage over the existing system, which *is* almost exclusively random choice (you go to school where you happen to live). This slight improvement in the quality of decision-making is the force that drives the market's engine - the better schools start to leech off the funding of the lesser schools, *and so it begins*.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is hard to believe that such a slight reallocation of resources can eventually have a major impact, but we can learn from the example of evolution. In nature, if a certain gene causes a nearly infinitesimal increase in chance of survival, over thousands of generations that gene will proliferate and eventually become ubiquitous - just look how quickly evolution came up with light-coloured skin. Analogously, money leached from lesser schools will give the better schools a slightly better chance of survival in the tumult of the market - a slightly better chance of sticking around over time.

If the government can tax your income, do you really own your own time?\r\n\r\nOnce people are already paying for services, there's no reason to avoid using them.  Yet many people, given the choice between paying and using / not paying and not using for any given service, would chose to not pay and not use.  The problem is they lack the choice to not pay.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of like a criminal taking $100 dollars from you and leaving behind a sandwich.  If you eat the sandwich, is that the same as condoning the theft?  And if this theft/sandwich act is reapeated, is it fair for the criminal to say \"if you want it to stop, just move!\"  Even if he only takes $20, or $5, it doesn't make it voluntary!  Maybe you don't even like sandwiches.\r\n\r\nI pay taxes for using public roads -- if I drive on them, does that mean I agree with being taxed?  (I don't drive, so that's even worse)  Given a choice to not pay taxes for roads, many people would switch to other forms of transportation.\r\n\r\nMy point is, I'd have no argument with a government that doesn't use coercion, and just requires payment for services as they are used.  Such a government would shrink drastically, once people are allowed the choice of saving money by not using govt-owned resources and private competition picks up.  In fact, such a government could hardly be called a government at all.  But taxing people is always coercion, as is preventing private competition (i.e. the post office).", "This doesn't mean that the minimum wage is a good thing -- Wal-mart supports it too.

Do they mean it hurts their competitors, while having no effect on their own business?  If they are affected, and they think that's good, why didn't they just pay more in the first place?

Let's ignore motivation and assume that there are selfless people in government, while consumers and businessmen are selfish.  Even if you just want to help others, only in business does the market tell you when you're doing a good job.  In government you can be the most kind-hearted person, but you will only hear from those who you helped, not those whose taxes you used to do it, and you'll have no way of knowing whether you caused more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf you (a businessman) build a road and make a profit, then you know that the goods you used up to make the road are less valuable than the service you're providing, so society as a whole has benefited.  If you build a road and lose money, then you know that you are destroying wealth and hurting society, and the market is telling you this in a very persuasive way.  When a greedy businessman hurts society, he gets punished.\r\n\r\nHow does the government know how it's doing?  Sure it can ask people (let them vote), but people will vote for things as long as they think other taxpayers are going to pick up the tab.  You could say \"This road will only be financed by tolls, not taxes, so as to preserve profit and loss signals\", but if private competition is not allowed how do you know that someone wouldn't have done a better job and undercut you?  And finally, if you do allow private competition, then you've ceased to become a government!\r\n\r\nIn the real world, government-owned roads commonly do have lots of traffic which could be alleviated by tolls.  In fact, London now charges people to enter the city in order to decrease traffic, which has worked a bit.  Unfortunately, governments can only emulate the market in a very clumsy and vague manner, so London is treated as a unit even though there are probably big traffic differences for different parts.  Some parts are still very busy, but others which weren't congested still apply the charge.  And London's government is rare -- most just ignore the traffic.", "Hey, that's pretty interesting.

Let's say you're addicted to opium today -- not so much that you can't work, but enough that you don't want to stop taking it.  If opium were legal, it would be a lot cheaper, because those selling it would not have to spend resources evading law enforcement.  You could work a normal job, just like a cigarette smoker.  Not only that, but the quality of the drug would be much more reliable -- openness tends to reveal deceit in drug composition.\r\n\r\nHowever, with opium illegal, it's very expensive.  If you are addicted, you need a lot more money to finance your addiction, plus you have to deal with the underworld to get at the drug.  All this provides a strong incentive to commit crimes to support your habit.\r\n\r\nChanging who makes the money *does* help the problem.  Right now, the money goes to drug lords and their gangs.

For the past 4-5 hours, I have been arguing with this guy who kept claiming that:\r\n\r\n&gt; **Mathematics can be qualitative, not just quantitative.**\r\n\r\nTo me, that statement seems wrong on such a basic fundamental level that I cannot readily comprehend how anyone could possibly argue in favour of it.

For 4-5 hours, I patiently went along with statement after statement, persuasion after persuasion and countered it as best I could.\r\n\r\nWhat made it more difficult is that my opponent seems to not want to specify with crystal clarity what he means.  One of his arguments was \"because mathematics can tell us qualitative things [, it is qualitative]\".\r\n\r\nI gather he means things like using mathematics to figure out whether or not a near-earth asteroid will zoom by or crash into the pacific ocean.\r\n\r\nI would then point out that while the information gained is arguably qualitative, it is gained mathematically in a quantitative way.  This did not convince him that he was wrong, though nor did he refuse to give a different line of argument by which he felt himself right.\r\n\r\nThe even more bizarre turn of events came when a friend of my opponent arrived who kindly called her father (who is a mathematics professor of some sort) to ask, \"Can mathematics be qualitative as well as quantitative?\"\r\n\r\nThe mathematics professor's reply was,\r\n&gt; \"oh, definitely yes\".\r\n\r\nThen the professor gave an example... \r\n\r\n&gt; 1. imagine you have a closed circle, **n** units in diameter. THey can be any type of unit at all.\r\n&gt; 2. It stands to reason that you can cover the circle completely with **n** planks or strips, each **1** unit wide that are infinite in length\r\n&gt; 3. The problem is, can you cover the sphere in LESS THAN N strips?\r\n\r\nApparently the answer to this is not known... and in what way this is supposed to be proof, was stated by my opponent's friend in the following way:\r\n\r\n&gt; it has almost nothing to do with any concrete quantities.  it's about manipulating concepts that have mathematical properties.  but not about any specific quantity\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at this time the mathematics professor hung up, and we were left on our own again... my opponent and his friend seemed to think that because **n** in the above does not require a specific value, it is qualitative.\r\n\r\nI retorted with, but **n** can be *any* quantitative value.  Whereas **n** could not be a qualitative value like 'blue' or 'justice' or 'fastidiousness'.\r\n\r\nWhen it turned out that we did not in fact agree on my previous sentence, I had shortly thereafter decided to call it a night and leave the twilight zone.\r\n\r\nWas I wrong?

Your example is actually a reductio ad absurdum - Nazi Germany was not a socialist state and so your definition fails to have meaning. As for Russia, George Orwell was a noted socialist who considered the Soviets to have bastardised the term. Capitalism is a human invention and its purpose is to best serve man's interests not vice-versa. Socialism is simply a moral outlook (this is why Jesus has often been called an early socialist) which has it that the good of the individual is best reached by serving the good of the group. Socialists believe that capitalism has a tendency to be self-defeating and extremely destructive to society if allowed to run wild (most capitalists also believe this which is why there aren't any pure free-markets outside the failed experiments). Most socialists believe that capitalism isn't inherently evil and can be put to use in a mixed economy providing it operates with safeguards. Of course this is no different in principle to mainstream capitalism as practised in any successful economy. If you accept a mixed market, the economic definition of socialism is largely a moot point and the argument is really about how best to implement a society we want to live in (e.g. how much inequality is acceptable) - or whether as Margaret Thatcher was famously derided for saying, 'there is no such thing as society'.", "not sure what your point was but out of curiosity how would you define the difference?", "&gt; I have never understood why someone would just start believing stuff like Christianity or Islam, without any proof except someone telling them that this is the way the world is... this is patently absurd\r\n\r\nI think Douglas Adams hit the nail on the head when he speculated that things like intolerance of dissent, refusal to rationalise or question and requirement of faith are essential properties of religions.

You say I didn't make an argument... but it's right there in black and white--declaratory sentences and all. To reiterate, my point was that _common law_ as per your claims, couldn't appropriate funds or otherwise respond to generalized governmental functions because, well, you'd need a case before the court in the first place, but more, common law can never respond as quickly to large problems. And finally, courts just aren't set up to engage in discerning broad, legislative fact-gathering and sorting (the legitimacy arguments aside). \r\n\r\nThe State responded poorly to this particular case because, well, it did.

As a libertarian, should I support or oppose Obama? More generally speaking, as a libertarian, should I abandon the Republican party which has done so little that is defensible from a libertarian standpoint and so much that is indefensible? Let us look.\r\n\r\n&gt;The junior Senator from Illinois observed that in 2006 many of America's people \"have had their faith shaken.\" \"The world has changed but things in Washington have not changed\" and this has led to an assault on the American dream. Politicians in Washington are constrained by \"smallness.\" \"The timidity of our politics is holding us back.\"\r\n\r\nSmallness? What smallness? Republicans today are big government Republicans, but Obama seems to think they are small-government Republicans. That's a point against Obaama.\r\n\r\n&gt;Barack Obama said that the solution to this problem lies in the American people. It's time for the electorate to reassert their will, to say they've \"had enough.\" \"Enough of broken promises and failed leadership. Enough of can't do and won't try.\" He argued that we all should have had enough of an Administration that can't make our ports safe but will spend billions on crony contracts. That claims to be serious about defending the homeland, but could not respond effectively to Hurricane Katrina. That can't come up with plan for Iraq or to ensure our national competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't say much, it's negative about Republicans but does not give us Obama's vision, so on to the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n&gt;Obama remarked that the roots of this problem are clear. They lie \"in the philosophy of this administration, in their believe that government is the problem.\" He said that taken to the extreme this ideology is \"social Darwinism. The belief that we are all on our own. That each of us is responsible for our own education, healthcare, and levees.\"\r\n\r\nWhoa, big problem there. Obama is attacking the belief that government is the problem. That sure is not any sort of libertarian statement. It's directly against libertarian, it's 180 degrees against libertarian. Republicans have not by any stretch of the imagination been governing to impress the more libertarian component of their constituencies. The big Republican misdeeds from a libertarian standpoint have been massive increases in government activity, starting with the war in Iraq. Government wiretapping is another concern. Airport nonsecurity, massive increases in welfare spending, proposed anti-homosexual legislation - all of these are uses or attempted uses by the Republicans of government power, and rther than attack this massive use of government power by Republicans, Obama chooses to attack Republicans for paying lip service to the idea that government is the problem!\r\n\r\nWell, government is the problem. And that sentiment pretty much defines the libertarian point of view, so Obama is setting himself up as farther away from the libertarians than President Bush. Which is quite an accomplishment.\r\n\r\n&gt;The junior Senator from Illinois noted that the GOP approach does not work in a democracy. He argued that the American way of life has two components: \"individual initiative and mutual regard, the belief that I am my brother's keeper and my sister's keeper.\" Democrats must reassert that mutual regard is a vital component of government.\r\n\r\nThat's vague rhetoric, but the notion of \"brother's keeper\", especially in the light of the previous assertions by Obama, suggest that Obama is making the case for a massive increase in government's role in our lives. Americans can of course be their brother's keeper by means of private charity, but Obama isn't campaigning to become president of a private charity, he's a politician, his solutions are government solutions, so he evidently wants government to do what private charities do. And that is not libertarian.\r\n\r\n&gt;Obama concluded that it is time for Americans to have a debate about where we are going and what we are about. Republicans have a timid vision, the downsizing of democracy. He called upon Democrats to proclaim, \"that every American family deserves the right to the American dream.\" He argued that all Americans deserve to \"dream without limits and achieve without constraints.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans have a timid vision? Of what, of the government's role in society? Presumably. Well, if Obama thinks the Republicans have a timid vision of the government's role then that's another strike against Obama (and against the Democratic party, in which Obama is a, maybe the, rising star).\r\n\r\n&gt;On Thursday, Barack Obama shared his vision of nation building. His image of an America restored because its citizens have regained the ability to dream and to live in community. He remembered the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., \"The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.\" Noting that we all need to work together to bend the arc, he implored his rapt audience to join in the struggle for an America with liberty and justice for all. Obama concluded, \"If [after 105 years] Marguerite Lewis isn't tired, then I'm not tired.\"\r\n\r\nMore vague rhetoric. In conclusion, Obama sets himself up as being on the opposite side of Republicans from libertarians. Obama is for an expansive view of government.\r\n\r\n", "Kerry was no more intelligent than Bush. He was one hell of a lot more arrogant.", "But you could equally ask: if grabbing random people off the streets of New York to perform experiments on their freshly killed corpses is always bad regardless of benefit, then how does one justify the war in Iraq?\r\n\r\nAnd my answer to that, and Ponnuru's answer to that, is that there is a distinction. And the biggest distinction is whether civilians/innocents are the intentional targets. Even in the Iraq war, soldiers who get out of hand and deliberately and with malice murder civilians, have committed a wrong and are recognized to have done so, and where there are allegations of that happening those allegations are investigated. You can be cynical about this but they do at least go through the motions, so they do recognize a distinction, even in the middle of war, between deaths where innocents are specifically targeted, and deaths where civilians are inadvertently killed.\r\n\r\nAnd you can say, \"but the original statement did not mention the qualification about the killing being deliberately targeted\" - yeah, but that was Stewart's formulation, and anyway it's quite normal to make a statement that is a simplification of your full view, especially on television with time constraints. I think you have to accept the qualification and not keep harping on the point that the original formulation did not include it.", "&gt; Reason: Can you give us an example of what you consider to be a good regulation and then an example of what you consider to be a not-so-good regulation?\r\n\r\n&gt; Coase: This is a very interesting question because one can't give an answer to it. When I was editor of The Journal of Law and Economics, we published a whole series of studies of regulation and its effects. Almost all the studies--perhaps all the studies--suggested that the results of regulation had been bad, that the prices were higher, that the product was worse adapted to the needs of consumers, than it otherwise would have been. [...]\r\n\r\n&gt; Reason: What's an example of bad regulation?\r\n\r\n&gt; Coase: I can't remember one that's good. Regulation of transport, regulation of agriculture-- agriculture is a, zoning is z.

There were so many studies, and the result was quite universal: The effects were bad. \r\n\r\nThat's from the 1997 Reason Magazine interview with Coase (easily googlable). Coase doesn't conclude that all regulation is therefore bad, but the evidence speaks for itself in showing us that quite a lot of it is bad - evidently, the extreme majority of it.", "&gt;I find the position of opposing rape except in the case of rape and incest to be the most morally indefensible position possible\r\n\r\nI'm sure most people oppose rape unconditionally.

Going over each in turn:\r\n\r\n* With CEO pay, the shareholders elect a board which hires a CEO.  In order to consider shareholder's ability to change the board as a real source of power, we need to actually see it exercised.  How many times have you seen shareholders fire their board?  Thus, prices spiral.\r\n\r\n* Most people don't pay for their own health care.  They are removed two steps from it: their company pays premiums to an insurance company, and the insurance company pays the doctors and drug companies.  The insurance company can exert some price pressures, so health care costs don't rise anywhere near as much as CEO pay.\r\n\r\n* College studensts hardly ever pay their own bills.  The money comes from a variety of loans, government, and parents.  Parents are often pushed by society into thinking \"education is worth any cost\" and pay appropriately.  I think more parents are catching on, but that's running up against limited supply.  The number of spots for freshmen in   any given set of top-tier schools (however you wish to define \"top-tier\") is going to remain relatively constant over the next generation, but the parents with disposable income to compete for those spots is going to grow.\r\n\r\nWhew.  I digressed.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, shareholders need to figure out a way to exert control over their board.  The only practical way for most small shareholders to do this is to only buy stock in companies that have reasonable CEO pay.

As long as it's a choice.\r\n\r\n[This article](http://reddit.com/goto?id=5zzp) makes an excellent argument for virginity as a conscious choice. I don't agree with everything she says, but she is obviously thinking for herself and trying to do the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe problem is with chastity, virginity, abstinence, etc. being advocated as systematically superior for everyone. Any rational study done on these programs shows that they are at best nonproductive and at worst counterproductive.\r\n\r\nAnd anyone who actually thinks about the problem can clearly see why. Essentially what they're saying is that sex should ideally happen between two people in a trusting, committed relationship. I'm a liberal atheist, and I agree with this -- not only because it's physically and emotionally safer, but because it makes for better sex. The problem is that all of these complex and difficult issues -- trust, mutual respect, care and consideration for each other -- are being neatly packaged under the label \"marriage\". Yes, I agree that that's what marriage *should* be, but there is absolutely nothing to guarantee that that is what it *is*. And if young people have it hammered into their heads that marriage is the only acceptable gateway to sex, then when those young people reach adolescence and young adulthood, guess what they'll do? Get married at the wrong time, to the wrong people, for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nThe biggest sin of \"abstinence before marriage\" campaigns (and, again, I am strongly distinguishing between the mass public relations campaigns and individual choice informed by personal and family advice) is to put the cart before the horse. To teach young people that marriage is what you do to *make* a stable relationship, instead of what you do *after* you have made a stable relationship. To push them into getting married because they are physically attracted to someone instead of gradually developing experience with relationships and gaining a true understanding of the level of commitment marriage should entail.\r\n\r\nThe end result, again, should be easily predictable.

Focusing on von Braun was interesting, because in previous works on the subject, his role has been either downplayed or completely ignored (not surprisingly, I suppose). This put an interesting new light on a subject we've all seen covered many times. But the really interesting part was the story of the Soviet program, sustained almost single-handedly by Korolyov's passion, and of the numerous complications, setbacks, and disasters they suffered alongside their well-known successes.\r\n\r\nThe acting was generally good -- the roles of von Braun and Korolyev were particularly well cast.

The Jane Austen thing was an analogy to explain a phenomenon, not an argument. The point is that Lisp looks hard, like Jane Austen, and so people often get turned off by it despite its greater power, just like people get turned off of Jane Austen. \r\n\r\nHere's a straight logical summary, if you don't like analogies: \r\n\r\nLemma: If you have parse-tree macros, you're basically a dialect of Lisp. \r\n\r\nProof: Lisp's defining quality is that you are basically typing in a notation for trees (s-expressions). These trees are the abstract syntax trees that get generated by the compiler in all other languages, like Java. The defining difference with Lisp is that you can a) see these trees, and b) manipulate them with arbitrary code before they get compiled but after they get parsed. So if you invent a new notation for trees (e.g. XML), define a language based on it, and allow the programmer to manipulate it before it gets compiled, you basically have a new dialect of Lisp. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, parse-tree macros (i.e. Lisp macros) are exactly programs that manipulate parse trees before they get compiled. So by the previous derivation, if you have parse-tree macros, you're a dialect of Lisp. \r\n\r\nClaim: Programming languages vary in power, and in particular Lisp is the most powerful. \r\n\r\nProof outline:\r\n\r\n1) Lisp can do at least one thing (macros) that no other language can do, by the lemma. \r\n\r\n2) This thing allows it to do everything every other language has ever done. \r\n\r\nProof: As established, Lisp and only its dialects have parse-tree macros. Now, the point of macros is that you can define new constructs. In fact, you can define absolutely any possible construct, because you can write any possible code to define that construct. So given any other language feature from any other language, you can write it into your language by adding it as abstract syntax. \r\n$\\square$\r\n\r\nThis is why Lisp programmers seem such ridiculous posers. Their language *really does* have a unique advantage. \r\n\r\nEdit: Back to the original question, which is why don't more people use it. This is basically explained by people not understanding the difference between Lisp and other languages, because they don't understand macros or why they're useful. This, in turn, is because they don't program in Lisp. This is a fairly effective formula for unpopularity.", "No. Here's the sequence of evaluation:\r\n\r\n(head (tail '(* 3 4))) \r\n\r\nStep 1: interpreter says, ok it's a quote don't evaluate it. \r\n\r\n(head (tail (quote (* 3 4))))\r\n\r\nStep 2: apply tail to the list (* 3 4), which has three elements: *, 3, and 4. Clearly, the tail of this list is just the list with 3 and 4, which is to say '(3 4). Thus, step 2 returns the list '(3 4). \r\n\r\n(head '(3 4))\r\n\r\nStep 3: Apply the function head to the list (3 4). This list has two elements, 3 and 4.

No. This is not the case. In fact, science is the opposite-- ideally, *anyone* who comes along and reads the literature can sit down and *try* XYZ and in fact *get* ABC.

I made no value judgments of this in my post, and any you took out of it were based on your preconceptions not mine.  I meant only to point out that there are groups which are tolerated and those which are not.  The original poster echoed the modern sentiment of 'tolerance, tolerance, tolerance' all for the sake of tolerance; it is a word devoid of meaning from its over-use.

Exchange rates and lesser standard of living allows you to employ impoverished workers for less because technology allows us to take advantage of local conditions remotely.  That's not the same as us disallowing MORE advanced technology.\r\n\r\nTwo, even disallowing advanced technology is only a short-term problem if you work to compete; the only way you really lose an industry is to outsource it.  As long as you have something in-house, you always have a shot.  Example:\r\n\r\n&gt;Japanese companies were encouraged to import foreign production technology but were required to produce 90 per cent of parts domestically within five years. It is said that the short-term hardship of Japanese consumers (who were unable to buy the superior vehicles produced by the world market) was more than compensated for by the long-term benefits to producers, who gained time to out-compete their international rivals.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Trade_Theory", "&gt; High-end cameras already use 36 bits, and there will be a trend to 48 and then 96 bits.

GCC is the one compiler that works on basically every CPU in use, from embedded devices to PlayStation dev kits.  He also started the FSF, and the GNU GPL was instrumental in making Linux the force it is today -- the BSDs never caught on like Linux did.  The GNU licenses (GPL and LGPL) are also the most frequently used for free software packages.\r\n\r\n&gt;I'm always fascinated by his well-reasoned position of flaming his gnu volunteers for happening to mention they just had a kid.\r\n\r\nBad example.  It wasn't a flame, and it's a personal opinion unrelated to software, asking posts remain on-topic and then including information about over-population.  I'll quote one of the replies: *\"Has breeding become such a religion that the mere mention of a an oposing view ignites a fury of vile replies?\"*\r\n\r\nYou seem to dislike him, but you don't seem to have objective reasons.  Your posts read like \"Stallman is teh suck\", ironically.\r\n\r\n[edit: fixed typo and changed \"applications\" to \"devices\"]", "\"Is it in you?\"", "Ok, here's a theory.  Being gay is like salt in bread -- it stops the yeast from growing too quick (and then dying out too fast).  In communal animals, it is a kind of check on population growth.

The BIcep has two \"heads\", and different exercises work them to different degrees.  There is a muscle book showing MRIs after different exercises so you can see what part was really affected.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0880119381/103-2685852-4832648\r\n\r\nAbs have multiple parts, and you can certainly get uneven development, e.g. martial artists who kick with one leg more than the other.\r\n\r\nIt is individual muscle fibers that contract all the way or not; not the muscles themselves.  So if you lift a lighter weight, you aren't contracting all of them a little bit -- you are contracting a smaller amount of fibers all the way.\r\n\r\nThe REAL ab workout myth is that of \"spot reduction\".  You don't lose bodyfat in just one specific area when you exercise; you lose a little fat from all over your body, in proportions determined by your genetics.  For example, some people might store more fat on their thighs; some on their abdomen; some on their sides.  If you store, say, 50% of your bodyfat on your abdomen, then when you lose 10 pounds of fat, 5 will be from that area.  \r\n\r\nWorking out your abs will make very little difference when it comes to having a six-pack.  If you want to see your abs, you must get rid of most of the fat on that area.  This means either a low bodyfat percentage, or being someone who genetically stores very little fat there (and more somewhere else), or liposuction.\r\n", "Trade as a general principle; but what do you trade?  Technology.  Software is the latest form of it.\r\n\r\n\"Free\" trade is a myth, as evidenced by patents, copyrights, and government restriction on helpful businesses like my plan for a \"geek prostitution squad\" composed of ex-IT folks whose jobs have been offshored.  We offer training and certification in over 35 \"arts\".  At least that's my business plan.\r\n\r\n", "Computer Science has fuck-all to do with programming as a career.  My CS professors couldn't program their way out of a paper bag.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was to get your attention, but it's often the case and not just exaggeration.  Computer Science (which of course isn't a science) has more to do with theory.  Of course there is overlap between CS and programming but CS != programming.  I also find the notion that everyone needs to physically go to a classroom, hauling paper books and listening to a human SPEAK information in order to learn to be laughable.\r\n\r\nYou can read information more quickly than you can hear someone talk about it, and you can skip reading the sections you already know.  Having online reference makes a lot more sense than flipping through a hardcover book as well.  Not to mention, the only way you are going to get good at programming is by doing it, JUST like art -- going to art school lectures does not make you an better artist.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn CS proper, you can get the same textbooks that are used to teach the subject and learn it yourself.  Most teachers don't have time in lecture to cover all the material so you have to do this anyway even if you go to a university.  \r\n\r\nA substantial amount of CS is practicable, just like a good chunk of mathematics is used for physics; and to give one example familiar to many, \"theoretical\" constructs like imaginary numbers turn out to be useful for actual circuits.  So there's an ever-growing amount of theory that finds applications, but there is still a big difference between math and physics, similar to CS and programming.\r\n\r\nVarious minor subjects like recursion and big-O function magnitude do not require a large investment of time -- which is probably why they are taught in introductory CS courses.    Anyone interested in programming is going to find ongoing education essential, but this has nothing to do with CS per se or having a degree.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, CS degrees can be completed with widely varying coursework, with an emphasis on different subsets of the field.  If you want to hire someone to do a specific task, you need to find someone with the necessary skills -- and a degree in CS versus CE versus Philosophy versus no degree does not tell you if the person has the skills you want.  It doesn't matter what it \"generally\" tells you since you aren't hiring for a \"general\" position, but rather something specific, and thus need to look at *individuals*.\r\n\r\nOf course you usually can't hire the best programmers anyway because they are working for themselves or otherwise on a project that is more interesting than your ASP.NET migration contract.  \r\n", "A little brain damage makes you fit in better with the rest of the population.", "&gt;Laws are necessarily a one-size-fits-all, and it's simply not possible to fashion a sliding scale for such cases.\r\n\r\nActually, there is a sliding scale for such cases.  Penalties differ based on the ages of the two parties; e.g. some divide it up into 14 and under, 15-18, and if the older party is above or below 18, 22, etc.  It differs by state.  It turned out to be necessary because one-size-fits-all penalties often were severely disproportionate.\r\n\r\n&gt; your implied claim that all 15-year-olds are capable of consent. They aren't.\r\n\r\nI don't see the problem with two 15-year-olds boning each other, even though it's probably illegal most places.  Or with two 17-year-olds... and you know one will turn 18 before the other, which suddenly makes it a different type of crime in some jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nOf course in many states the age is 16 which kind of shows how capricious the issue is.  You can be a lifelong sex offender in one state for what would just be boning your high school girlfriend/boyfriend in another.\r\n", "&gt; if the parents are gay then any adopted children would be more likely to be\r\n\r\nCuz we all know that heterosexual parents have only heterosexual children.\r\n", "&gt; The 10 or so that I know are pretty happy about being able to be here, I think they would take offense at being called indentured.\r\n\r\nThey are indentured because they can't freely change their employment.

I have two problems with this. First, you meet the classic self-referential set (from Cantor, I think) paradox: Does the set of all sets which don't contain themselves, contain itself? Richard's is just an example of this paradox, since by saying how the diagonalization is made, *he describes the number*!

Imagine I write \"The number represented by the ratio of ideal circle's circumference to its radius, and by the way, ignore anything after this period. LALALALA\". Then, if my diagonalization changes something in LALALA, I have the same number, so diagonalization fails!\r\n\r\nSimilarly, since I can reference the rest of the universe, with a finite number of letters, I can refer to an infinite (dunno countably or not) number of objects.

To counter some of his points.\r\n\r\n* Yes, there is less file size, because the CSS file only has to be downloaded once.\r\n* Tables are OK to use for tabular data, just not for design.\r\n* KISS principle. CSS is simpler. I can write HTML that makes perfect sense, using id and class names that give each element a context. e.g. &lt;h1 class=\"articleTitle\"&gt; makes more sense than remembering that all titles are written as &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"7\" color=\"red\"&gt;.\r\n* He whinges that IE doesn't display exactly the same as all other browsers. OK, here's a tip: think of HTML styles as \"suggestions\". Each browser will do their best to follow your suggestions, but some will get it wrong. Or, a user might have settings that override your suggestions. The trick is to expect this and design in a way that is flexible. You are an idiot if you are trying to get pixel perfect layouts (except for a few special cases).\r\n* CSS is more readable. See the example I gave above. That beats scrolling up a few pages of code to see which embedded table I'm looking at.\r\n* How often do you need a style for a single element on a single page? Not very often, so his point about \"forgetting\"  what CSS is for is irrelevant. If you are not sure you will remember then add a comment: &lt;!-- Main page login form --&gt;. Wow, that was hard.\r\n\r\nI had trouble when I first started using CSS, but learning it has made my job so much easier. The best tip I can offer is to NOT try and create CSS designs in they same way as table based designs. If you do that then you loose all the flexibility that you have and you'll just get frustrated. Many people new to CSS will think \"how would I design this with tables\" and then try and replicate that design with CSS. This is the one thing that CSS is bad at. You need to learn to layout your pages in a way that suits CSS.\r\n\r\nOnce you get past the basics you'll begin to find heaps of great tools that make design so much easier (white-space, overflow, pseduo-elements).

However, I don't have much hope that such an alternative won't require large amounts of man-power which will cause our society to return to an agrarian society.  \r\n\r\nThe energy we consume from oil is a staggering amount.

After all, there is plenty of coal and there are other sources of energy such as nuclear.  Unfortunately, coal power is bad for greenhouse gasses and nuclear is opposed by many people.\r\n\r\nEven if we can change people's minds about nuclear power, it takes years to build a plant (and a lot of oil) and, unless breeder reactors are used (which face stiffer political opposition due to the resulting generation of plutonium), we only have known reserves of fissionable material to power the world for a decade or two at current rates of consumption.\r\n\r\nI hope you can see that our energy future is currently not bright.  Note also, that I have not discussed replacing any material products that come from oil with alternatives.\r\n\r\nIf all of this isn't bad enough, of greater concern than oil is water.

Total depletion to date amounts to some 325 bcm, a volume equal to the annual flow of 18 Colorado Rivers. The Ogallala stretches from Texas to South Dakota, and waters one fifth of US irrigated land. Many farmers in the High Plains are now turning away from irrigated agriculture, as they become aware of the hazards of overpumping, and realise water is not in endless supply.\r\n\r\nCombine the three things that seem inevitable: a forced move away from a cheap energy society, a long term (perhaps permanent) chronic water shortage, and global warming.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that I think it is very prudent to question whether we should continue to expand our population or should we pause until we have solutions to problems that currently appear to be inescapable.", "We are treating the best we can.

We've already done it; it shouldn't be seen as some sort of blacklisted term.\r\n\r\nSome basic examples:  I have sacrificed my liberty to kill whomever I want in order to guarantee (to some extent) that someone will not kill me, at least not without facing consequences.  I have sacrificed my liberty to do whatever I want with the money I earn in order to keep our infrastructure running (taxes aren't \"optional\").  I have sacrificed my right to drive as fast as I want, to ensure road safety for all.  Etc.\r\n\r\nNow of course I believe there are some rights, liberties, etc that aren't worth sacrificing no matter the cost, like freedom of religion and freedom of speech.  But my right to hold a \"private\" conversation over the phone and my \"right\" to keep the content of my bank account secret?  I'd sacrifice those for a little added security.

The fact that he is an ex-oil baron makes this point interesting to say the least, but he has put effort into developing e85 and biodisel.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as his funding is concerned, your comment lacks understanding.  His campaign may have been supported by big donors, which may include oil companies, but his \"Administration\" is paid for by every tax-paying citizen.\r\n\r\nThat Bin-Laden comment is just a sucker punch.  Bin-Laden wages war to oppress women and force people to conform to strictly government-enforced social restrictions.  The US wages war to liberate; your doubts about the motives of governemnt officials are well founded.

But I don't think any of them mean literal as in \"every word stands as it means\", like some goat is going to marry a city.\r\n\r\n&gt;Well, I've seen some argument that that the references (especially NT) to homosexuality were actually intended to refer specifically to pederasty.\r\n\r\nI've heard that--that the word for \"homosexuality\" refers to an older man with a juvenile.  Even IF this is the case, it's hard to get around Romans 1, which talks about how some men turned away from the original intention of their creation and started having sex with eachother instead of women.  We also have to look at it with a broader view.  God created the world (whether through evolution or in 7 days) with a beautiful system.  Everything works in cycles; every living thing reproduces.  Homosexuality, in its very nature, goes against the natural cycle.  There has been no conclusive scientific evidence that there is a natural cause for homosexuality.\r\n\r\nPlease, I'm genuinely curious.  How do people excuse it?  I never hear anyone actually defend why they think homosexuality is right.  I'm always having to defend why I think it's wrong, and all they can come up with is this post-modern \"hyper-enlightenment\" 'you can't tell anyone what to do'/'as long as you don't hurt anyone its OK' attitude.\r\n\r\n&gt;I think that I can give an argument with broader appeal\r\n\r\nYeah.  That certainly is a good, broad-based arugument.  My whole argument was simply aimed at those who want to ban gay marriage based on the \"sanctity of marriage\".  They're barking up the wrong tree.

When I take an objective look at both theories, and all the evidence that accompanies both, I conclude that intelligent design theory makes more sense.  That's it.  I don't conclude that science itself is flawed; evolutionary theory is barely science.  There is no empiracle proof that we evolved from nothing!  We cannot observe it, or experiment with it.

Probably not, because most people assume that 'new earth' theory is rediculous.

But I'm not talking about the constitution persae, I'm talking about basic concept of Liberty vs. Security.  Let me try to illustrate:\r\n\r\nOn one end of the 'government spectrum', you have something resembling complete anarchy.  People fend for themselves; they find security in numbers and in firepower.  Whoever has the most people with the most guns will come out on top.  If you have a gun and your neighbor doesn't, you can rob, steal, rape, and kill all you want, and no one will do anything about it.  \"Government\" was invented to bring order and safety to a chaotic situation like this.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you have a totalitarian fascist state, where the government decides what you eat, what you wear, what you own, what you know, and what you feel (a la Equilibrium).\r\n\r\nNow, I'm sure you and I can agree that niether of these situations is ideal for America today, so we're talking about reaching a middle point somwhere between those two extremes.\r\n\r\nIraq before the war was a very secure place.  Saddam's police were high paid and did their jobs well.  The Iraqis sacrificed a lot of liberty for a lot of security, and today, some Iraqis and a lot of left-swinging westerners believe that they were better off under the Hussein regime.  Of course I do not believe this is the case, and you shouldn't either, judging from your arguments above.\r\n\r\nBut who's to say we have to go to either extreme?  Why can't we allow the government more ability to provide security LEGALLY install new 'checks and balances' to assure that our democracy continues?  It's just a matter of choice, of what the American people choose.  There's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" about increasing or decreasing the government's surveillence abilities within the context of adapting the constitution.\r\n\r\nAs for our founding fathers, they didn't understand the challenges our small world would bring to the constitution.  Jefferson himself envisioned that Americans (white people, of course), would enjoy a small federal government while we live productive lives as yeoman farmers.  Did he ever think two dudes would want to get married in his brand new country?  Or yet, that the government would allow that kind of thing?  Did he think the government would pay farmers money to produce surplus crops? Did he think we'd give people free money?  Did he think that the federal government would actually take an income tax?  I venture to say no to all these.  They certainly didn't think a single person could kill thousands, maybe even millions of people all by himself.  That's the kind of world we live in today.  We have much different needs than the people of the late 18th century and the constitution (as well as all of US law) has grown to meet these needs.\r\n\r\nTo sum up:  we're not talking about a terrorist coming in and kiling one or two people; we're potentially talking about a terrorist killing thousands, millions, even bringing our governmental infrastructure to its knees.  We need more security to protect us from these radical threats.  So lets sacrifice some small liberties.  It's worth it.\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note, it's just funny how when we're talking about social reform, the conservatives bitch about how the constitution is a hardended text while the liberals say it's a 'living, breathing document', but when it comes to gay marriage, all the sudden it becomes 'living and breathing' to the conservatives and when government surveillence is concerned the constitution becomes set in stone for liberals.

Think back; the WMD's were only a side note.  The forefront of our attacks were the 14 UN resolutions Saddam had violated and the fact that he had prohibited weapons inspectors from keeping him under tabs for 4 years.

And since I do believe in a supernatural creator figure and I'm willing to credit him with the initiation of the universe, creation science makes more sense.\r\n\r\nAs far as Relativity is concerned, Hiroshima proved more or less that special relativity or whatever is true.  They've done other experiments to more or less prove general relativity.  We've yet to see this kind of progression with evolutionary theory.  We keep finding fossils and such, and very creative scientists piece together an intricate story of how they evolved.  These theories are based on some assumptions that I find too hard to make. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n\"Nor have they disproved these [False Messiahs].\"\r\n\r\nNo, they haven't.  But it's difficult to prove a true proposition as well.  I can't \"prove\" to you that Jesus was the messiah any more than you can't \"disprove\" it to me.  But if you're looking for \"proof\", you're probably going to be dissapointed.  God created us with the ability to think and ration, but he also created us with emotions, the ability to \"feel\".  To make a long story short, my journey towards Christ began with me \"feeling\" it; I then scrutinized the evidence to find that I couldn't \"disprove\" it any more than I could \"prove\" it.  My \"feelings\" were enough to close any intellectual gap (due to lack of evidential \"proof\", not evidence against it).  I guess that's what we call faith.  \r\n\r\nI would also say that on that list of \"messiahs\", Jesus is the only one who is worshipped en masse today.

We have military might, but China has economic sway, and that affects how we use our might.\r\n\r\n3) 'Equality of opportunity' is a convenient fiction.  Most people are severely limited in what they can achieve by their genetic makeup, and their personal history.  We like to believe in 'equality of opportunity' because it makes our market system seem less brutal.  Awareness of this will grow as the genetic bases of much of our behavior and capabilities become more apparent.  This awareness could result in a populist push toward the left at some point.\r\n\r\n4) Evolution is still happening, and it happens at a societal level.  Take a group of people from the 1800s in the US and transplant them to the present and they wouldn't thrive, even with education.  Each generation culls genes.  Each generation changes us.  We need to be aware of how our society evolves relative to others.  Each society has a level of fitness in relation to it's environment.

Copyright is an economic bargain with authors. We can argue on whether it is a good or a bad bargain for the people to make. Moral rights are the legal recognition of a strong intuition that I, together with most people commenting in this thread, appears to share: to wit, that it is not legitimate, it is an outrage, to misrepresent oneself as the author of a creative work.

Protestants were a lot more hostile to science in some ways, for example wrt Kepler.

How about traditional European-style non-capitalist anarchism? Where does it fall on that chart?

One only need to see how fiercely the Soviets threw *everything* they had at the Germans in defending their southern frontier back to Stalingrad to see a fear of the German war machine was the last thing on Stalin's mind.\r\n\r\n&gt;the French under Napoleon are still the only army ever to have taken all of continental Europe, from Moscow to Madrid.\r\n \r\nI wouldn't call Napoleon's expedition to and retreat from Moscow \"owning\" it. (Great graphic of the advance, retreat and human loss [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Minard.png).)\r\n\r\nI don't think there's much to the notion that the French are \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", but this article grossly misrepresents history to make a political point.", "What the hell is this, myspace?

I mean, fine, but I can get that at alternet or indymedia or any other lefty site.\r\n\r\nBut while we're talking about the late, great labor unions, let's not pretend they're all workers' paradise - many unions are well known to have employed coercive tactics on employers, especially smaller shops that simply would not survive a strike or slowdown; they happily protect incompetent and/or lazy workers to the detriment of the good ones; closed shops keep nonunion labor out of work while [paying union workers not to work](http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0510/17/A01-351179.htm)(and passing the costs of such programs on to joe and jane consumer); not to mention some labor unions' dues border on usurious. As a nonunion worker I've never had to pay my boss to work, nor have I had to toe the union line even though my job is going well, and my compensation is not tied to how well my coworkers are doing.\r\n\r\nUnions perform a valuable service by allowing tradesmen and workers to pool their negotiating power - but let's not kid ourselves that unfettered unions are the answer to \"unfettered free markets\".", "my earlier point is that, by definition, *everyone* offering a political position is partisan.

It is evidenced by his notion of fleet defense, implied when he talks about how a flotilla of little ships \"[drove] the Navy crazy trying to keep track of them. When the Admirals finally lost patience and ordered all planes and ships to leave, van Ripen had them all attack at once.\" My father, who did a tour as a line officer on a US cruiser in the 70's, said the CiC on his ship could track vessels as small as zodiac inflatabless from at least 70 miles away - he related one instance where nearby scavengers in small boats and trawlers were being tracked one by one outside a cordon area as they prepared a missile test. Newer radar systems can do an even better job than that.\r\n\r\nIt is not the primary job of fighter bombers launched from aircraft carriers to maintain fleet defense, so the notion of \"sending all the planes away\" as some terrible strategic maneuver is woefully overstated. Fighter bombers are launched to knock out other planes and strike at largely immobile surface targets on land and sea. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the implication that the US fleet is particularly vulnerable to anti-ship missiles is just an old canard. ASW has been around as long as the guided missile itself, given, yes, their relative ease to design. But outside the NATO arsenal, anti-ship missiles are notoriously unreliable. Added to that fact is the notion that the US Navy has had a stand-off strategy of destroying hostile targets before they are in range of missiles. Thinking the US fleet will wander  in littoral waters off Iran and just sit around flinging planes into the air is also laughably naive.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this guy's fanboy attempts to sound like a military expert are pretty entertaining.", "But the question is, should that twisted sick fuck be \"respected as a human being\"?

While there are certainly huge price gougings going on, that doesn't mean that it is cheap to stay in a hospital.

Add the fact that you are getting say 1 full time person (actually a bunch of fragments of peoples time, but...) who makes $1000 per day. Add that they have to recover for other cases where they aren't paid. Call that $1000 a day. That's $3000 a day in an ICU. Or about $100,000 for the time period described in the article.

But I do believe that in all cases, \"magic or diabolically clever evil\" is simply the result of people with power acting in their own self-interests.  Power to infringe upon the rights of others is what makes them dangerous, even if they believe they are doing good.  In the case of socialism, individuals are given power to control an entire economy, and they often still act in their own self interests -- but even if they try to help people, they lack the price information necessary to do so.  In the case of corporatism, companies are allowed to buy control over the economy, so the results are similar to socialism, it just takes longer.  This is what's happening in the US right now.  Government power always goes to the highest bidder in a corporatist society, while in a socialist society, it always goes to the most charming people's hero and his/her friends.\r\n\r\n&gt; But in large scale industrial projects, social administration at the board of directors/executive level doesn't imply an innability to promote innovation or use 3rd party vendors that can provide it.\r\n\r\nIt does if you follow the money.  What incentives do these central planners have to complete a high-quality project on time and within a budget?  They're spending other people's money on something other people will use.  They won't be punished for failure, as long as they stick to standard procedure, and yet if they succeed by ignoring stupid rules, they will probably be punished.  It's easier to stick to standard overpaid vendors, who probably got the contract by lobbying rather than providing quality, and just ask for a bigger budget.\r\n\r\nThe real world evidence (of which I have yet to hear a counter-example) is that centrally planned government projects and programs are *never* on-time, on-budget, and high quality.

Since monopsony is an inefficient economic situation, and it's very difficult to determine the \"best\" minimum wage, it's better that it simply be avoided.  The question is: what, in the real world, causes this monopsony -- and how can this be avoided?  The answer is left as an exercise for the reader. :)", "The article mentions Friedrich von Hayek as a major influence on the US.  Trust me (or don't, just think about it), the \"crony capitalism\" in the US is a direct result of *ignoring* Hayek and Austrian economics in general.\r\n\r\nAustrians simply make a point of holding government (politicians) to the same standards as the free market (private citizens).  When you model politicians economically as normal, self-interested beings, the whole problem with government becomes clear -- when you give a person power, they will use it to help themselves.  In the case of politicians, this almost always involves helping or pretending to help their constituents/special interests at the expense of other citizens.  When you add this all up, the net result is far worse than if no politicians were \"helping\", because each interference in the economy destroys wealth as wealth is shifted around.  Not to mention that the government will always benefit the rich, since they can essentially buy coercive force from legislators.\r\n\r\nIf people paid attention to Hayek, the government would be far smaller than it is today, or even non-existent.

The generation after the giant Raphael (and the giant Durer in the North) is a much better candidate for cultural and artistic decline--a story complicated by Michaelangelo's inconvenient longevity.

It may just be a coincedence that apples always fall down. Gravity has no substance, it is only a theory. There's nothing to refute.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what? You'd be right. You cannot prove gravity exists. However, the scientific models (\"laws\") we use do happen to predict reality remarkably well.

It is a crutch that makes people understand *less* about the world, instead of more. If instead of gravity you believe there's a gravity-god that will make things fall down for arbitrary reasons, without including 'mass' and 'relative height' then you simply cannot gain a better understanding. You cannot learn to build bridges because gravGod decides for himself whether a bridge will collapse or not - so it doesn't matter if the bridge is soundly designed. If, on the other hand, before Newton you decided that a god of Gravity exists and that the god of gravity makes objects fall with an equal acceleration (regardless of mass), friction notwithstanding, then this belief in a gravity god would give you a better understanding of the world, a sensible one at that. It would allow you to build bridges that don't collapse. In this scenario it would make sense to believe in gravGod, because it is a better model of reality than whatever you had before.\r\n\r\nSo why would you voluntarily choose to believe in something that doesn't result in a better understanding of the world?\r\n\r\n[ I pray for safe transmision of the bits to reddit.com.

You seem to be saying a pre-emptive strike to prevent Iran from nuking other countries is \"good\", so then why let them get the nuclear weapons in the first place?

I think the much more reasonable assertion would be: people cannot intuit infinity.  This, however, should not be suprising, since our intuition is based on experience.  And who here has had the opportunity to deal with various orders of infinity on a regular basis (in the physical realm, that is)?\r\n\r\nE.g., we typically deal with modest speeds, and these are much much less than the speed of light.  Our intuition would n't suggest that an object's mass approaches inifnity as its speed approaches the speed of light; reason, without any requirements of emotional satisfaction, figured this out.\r\n\r\nPeople who are not mathematicians and are not inclined towards mathematics probably have a hard time believing this, because it just seems natural that two decimal expansions should represent two different numbers.

Not only can you not go refuting every *argument* there's also the issue of *facts* (or perhaps better, *data*) and who provided it, and what they have for a motive. If I had a blog, I think I'd write about it, but basically we have to take many things on faith (not the religious kind) in life. To keep this from being random, I think most of us set up \"trusted sources\" whom we've sometimes checked deeper on, and who seem informed, honest, right, whatever. I guess it mainly centers around facts, but also perhaps for longer stretches of logic and more complex deductions. This allows you to keep from having to start from zero, but involves, technically, logical weaknesses. Scarily enough, I think such trusted sources can sometimes be *more* important than a logical chain, as a good debater may show you. Just because you can't see the weak link in the logic doesn't mean it's not there.\r\n\r\nTo use the example from the article, if my top programmer friend from Google says it's the best system, and it's a similar problem, (and he didn't write the system and have a big ego :D) and some vender of a product says their own is the best system, I'll believe my friend.

They also do the \"zoom out\" type jokes. I can imagine that many such *specific* gags don't translate from English though.\r\n\r\nI find it's actually a pretty damn funny culture. (Although the joke about the German child isn't far off -- Here they have an expression \"Not criticized is praise enough\") \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, IMHO, they also have some fairly unfunny humor too (I don't find the Berlin or Cologne schtick very funny) but they have some great wackiness. Currently improv is quite popular here, too.\r\n\r\nThey also have stand-up, some is even televised. The whole article was a little strange -- obviously the guy writing it has direct, relevant experience, but he still seems to have missed the mark somehow.\r\n\r\nThey're also often willing to be a bit more risque: one of the first jokes I remember 'getting' when I came here centered on a saying they have \"First the work, then the pleasure\" (also very German).

I would say the most common car that bombs by at 200kph+ (135mph) is one of these. So better fuel efficiency is obviously possible without having to pile into mini-cars.\r\n\r\nIt's true public transportation is miles better than what is typical in North America (although here in Munich it's quite expensive too). There are also serious bike lanes, and a downtown core. Unfortunately, these thing will take much longer to bring into North America. I think a push for fuel efficiency would be fairly trivial in comparison.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin, things in general cost more here. Since the poor don't tend to be as poor as in North America, that's not such a big issue though.", "I think that charitable donations are definitely more part of the culture in America than in many other lands. It is definitely somewhat blurry though. For example, in Germany, if you don't actively \"leave the church\", a certain percent (3-4 I think) of your wages are automatically deducted, and given to the Church (Catholic or Protestant are your only choices). So that's a pretty huge chunk of change that most Germans \"donate\" which is overlooked.\r\n\r\nSince they also have a much better social net (probably too generous) there are very very few things like soup kitchens. So volunteerism is also considerably reduced. (You also have to factor in the German \"if you don't have a piece of paper which says you can do something, we don't think you can\" mentality, which I think also affects volunteerism, and second jobs in general.)\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to see how much money was given to *international* charities.

But now we are faced with a new shortage that taps another precious resource. Water only comes through the tap fours hours a day and we are forced to pay ten to hundred times what we paid in the 90s. Welcome to the world of privatized water, where fresh water is treated like a commodity, traded and sold in the international market to the highest bidder. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;No longer can you assume a God-given right to drink from a mountain spring, but instead you will have to pay a toll to drink from Enron Springs, Monsanto Wells or receive tap water from Bechtel Water Works. Global consumption of water is doubling every 20 years, more than twice the rate of human population growth. According to the United Nations, more than one billion people already lack access to fresh drinking water. If current trends persist, by 2025 the demand for fresh water is expected to rise by 56 percent more than the amount of water that is currently available. Multinational corporations recognize these trends and are trying to monopolize water supplies around the world. Monsanto, Bechtel, Enron and other global multinationals are seeking control of world water systems and supplies. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The World Bank recently adopted a policy of water privatization and full-cost water pricing. This policy is causing great distress in many Third World countries, which fear that their citizens will not be able to afford for-profit water. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Last year in a little known case of high scale international water marketing, a supertanker was reported to have filled up with water from Lake Erie and after paying the Canadian Government they shipped the water to Southeast Asia. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Maude Barlow, chair of the Council of Canadians, Canada's largest public advocacy group, states, \"Governments around the world must act now to declare water a fundamental human right and prevent efforts to privatize, export, and sell for profit a substance essential to all life. Research has shown that selling water on the open market only delivers it to wealthy cities and individuals. The finite sources of freshwater (less than one half of one per cent of the world's total water stock) are being diverted, depleted, and polluted so fast that, by the year 2025, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in a state of serious water deprivation.\" \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Governments are signing away their control over domestic water supplies by participating in trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and in institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Those things that Science has purported overwhelming proof, such as a heliocentric solar system, eventually take precedence.  What's funny is that the bible doesn't even say that the universe is geocentric, that was brough in centuries later by the Cathoic Heirarchy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Archaeology, a science, has doen wonders for showing that the bible itself is very accurate in its factual standings and geographic locations.

If I, a Christian, believe in \"Creationsim\", then I must hate all things rational and scientific, because of course Creationism deals with magic, faeries, and the divine-- things that are far from the mind of any rational human being, let alone a scientist.\r\n\r\nThe fact still remains that if you remove some base assumptions, like secular humanism--the assumption that the earth came to be founded by natural as opposed to supernatural means, and religious pluralism--the assumption that no one religion, especially christianity, is the only true religion, you find that there are some very interesting scientific explainations to how we arrived at where we are today.  \r\n\r\nI, for one, was an ardent christian evolutionist until I heard a presentation by Dr. Kent Hovind.

The constitution is an enlightenment text, based off the idea that man was created a 'free' creature with no restraints, and the government should do little to affect that 'freedom'.  The problem is these ideas were thought up by a man.  Mother nature, the earth, god, buddha, whatever, don't care if the constitution says you have the \"right to life\".  It isn't natural by any means.  \r\n\r\nBut now this author is implying (pretty heavily) that San Francisco has granted 'rights' that we should all have.

It's one thing if the majority loves the current situation.  But you'd be surprised how beloved the idea of a US invasion is in the Iranian masses.  The Guardian Council has had to put forth a substantial propaganda campaign (including free public showings if Farenheit 9/11) to convince the people that the US is their enemy.\r\n\r\nThe way Iran (and Iraq, for that matter) is run prevents any popular uprising.  The Guardian Council, like Saddam Hussein, is funded by oil money.  They don't need popular support.  When an uprising happens, they use their oil-funded personal army to crush it.  Saddam did this on a number of occasions.

In reality, very few people take ration to the extreme as to rule out everything miraculous.\r\n\r\nRation is only one part of the human experience.

Family B buys a house in Kansas for $100k, fixes it up, and lives in it for 30 years.  Say 10% of homeowners are families like A; they will sell 10% * 50% = 5% of homes in a given year.  The remaining 90% will sell 90% * 3% = 3% of homes.  Families like A sell 60% more homes than families like B, so the median reflects their purchases.\r\n\r\n&gt; It seems hardly likely that the housing industry would spent much time producing massive numbers of houses that could not be bought.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what they're doing.

I know who does what in a commercial enterprise, and I have equal appreciation for CEOs and workers alike. Claiming that either is more valuable than the other is nonsense. \r\n\r\nYes, I couldn't survive without our CEO, but he couldn't survive without me, either.

As an example, a men certainly approaches his male friends as people. However, as a woman, you most probably *don't* want a man to approach you as one of his male friends. \r\n\r\nIn fact, quite the opposite is true. In a relationship, you want to be something *special*. You want your partner to treat you differently than everyone else. *By definition*. If there's nothing special, you're not having a relationship.

But they never seem to consider marketing costs, retail/distribution markups (which dwarf anyone else's cut) and taxes. On top of this, the music industry business model is based on most releases losing money with the occasional one keeping the whole show afloat - so it is unfair to cherry-pick and find examples of a record company doing well out of a successful release and try and extrapolate that this is the norm. Of course none of this is to say that the record business doesn't blow plenty of artists' money on cars and coke or that there aren't plenty of cases of artists having unfair contracts - but there is a lot of ignorance regarding the basic business model (though I think it is becoming obsolete). For the last 20 years or so (since distribution opened up), there hasn't been much really to stop anyone from making a record under their own steam.

Either way, however, the author of this article is being disingenuous regarding animal treatment.  \r\n\r\nSwitching from the UK to the US for a moment, to quote the [Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine](http://www.pcrm.org/about/index.html):\r\n\r\n&gt;No law in the United States prohibits any experiment. The only federal law that applies to animals used for research\u2014the Animal Welfare Act\u2014is, for all intents and purposes, a husbandry statute that regulates the size of cages, cleanliness standards, provision of food and water, etc., for only a small fraction of the animals used in research. Animals in laboratories are routinely subjected to painful procedures and are usually killed afterward. Routine caging, isolation, handling, and even the laboratory environment itself are extremely stressful to animals. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Rats, mice, birds (who combined make up about 90 percent of all animals used in research), cold-blooded animals, and animals commonly used for food are excluded from the definition of \u201canimal\u201d under the Act and are therefore not given even these minimal protections. \r\n\r\nProtestors do not merely have \"old\" pictures of horrible experiments, but up-to-date undercover video footage as well.  You can see horrible abuse of primates, dogs, cats, you name it -- in the UK *and* the US.  There are no surprise visits from any kind of regulation enforcers, and 90% of the animals wouldn't be covered anyway.  \r\n\r\n[Here is a small selection of video footage regarding animal experimentation.](http://www.petatv.com/viv.html)  There is plenty more out there too, just google for it.  The reason this article is talking about a pro-experimentation group is because of undercover footage taken at UK animal labs which started off a major campaign by protestors to shut down those labs.  This led to a new designation of protestors as \"terrorists\" in the UK, which the author seems to be quite happy about.  \r\n\r\nThe second question is, are these experiments useful?\r\n\r\nThe [Physicians Committe for Responsible Medicine argues that it is not.](http://www.pcrm.org/resch/anexp/)  In fact, it IS harmful in two ways: drugs that pass animal testing which then hurt humans (Fen-Phen, Vioxx, Celebrex, Ambien, etc.) and drugs that are toxic to animals but help humans (e.g. penicillin and rats).  The article's citation of Thalidomide is ironic because it did pass animal testing; but you don't know what is going to happen with a pregnant woman until you try it on one.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of animal experimentation does not even involve pharmaceuticals, but is what is called \"basic research\".  What this usually means is a University research lab applying for a grant, then repeating some experiment done thousands of times before (say, on lead toxicity) in order to artificially create employment for people with a degree but no real job.  This is essentially what most pro-testing advocates are fighting for -- the gravy train of government grants which supplies them with paychecks.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical animal testing is a formality designed not to help ensure the safety of drugs for humans, but as a CYA move in the case of lawsuits so that there is something to point to; a bit like \"no one ever got fired for buying Microsoft\" even though there is no actual warranty.  Humans have in effect become guinea pigs because animal testing is a poor predictor of complex drug interactions with human physiology.  Pharmaceutical companies argue that very line when they have something that looks promising in the petri dish but doesn't work as hoped on animals, in order to get permission to move to human testing.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is better computer models.

So if we say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, we're being hypocritical because \"the lamb\" (jesus) is going to \"marry\" the \"new Jerusalem\" (christianity).\r\n\r\nBut the reason we tend to oppose gay marriage isn't just because \"the bible says so\".  The bible does take a stance against homosexuality; the old testament passage tells us simply that God doesn't approve of the practice.  The new testament lists homosexuality among other sins such as lying, fornicating, murder, etc.  The bible lets us know that it isn't part of God's plan for us.  Throwing verses back and forth won't change that impression.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. We alreadly allow unmarried couples to live together 'as if they were married', we allow men to go to clubs and feel up younger women while their wife and kids are sleeping at home, we allow prostitution in some parts, we allow divorce that destitutes families and psychologically wrecks children, and, in the end, we allow two men to have sex with eachother.  So, contrary to many who purport anti-gay legislation, marriage in american today is hardly \"sacred\", at least not on an institutional level.  Don't get me wrong, I love my wife, and our decision to wait until marriage for sex was the best choice we ever made.  But I'd say maybe 1 in 20 marriages in America today would actually qualify as \"sacred\". \r\n", "When did we equip Hussein's army?

Since I'm bored again:\r\n\r\n&gt; Even in the past century, the correlation is poor; the planet actually cooled between 1940 and 1980, when human emissions of CO2 were rising at the fastest rate in our history.\r\n\r\nYou can see the temperature graph yourself at http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/carbon_cycle/carbon_cycle_new.html\r\n\r\n&gt; The CO2 emissions of our civilization are also dwarfed by the 210 GT/year emissions of the gas from Earth's oceans and land.\r\n\r\nThis is misleading, because CO2 is constantly being emitted and reabsorbed by plants and animals into the atmosphere.  The important number, when trying to predict climate consequences, is the *net* change in carbon dioxide (emissions - reabsorption).  If natural activities are adding 150 gigatons into the atmosphere and removing 149.9 gigatons, then an additional 3 gigatons is a 30-fold increase in the rate of change of CO2.  If natural activities are adding 150 gigatons and removing 140, then the human-induced 3 gigatons is only 30%.  There is another diagram, later down on the same page, that has a global breakdown of sources of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n&gt; Katrina did not get \"stronger and stronger and stronger\" as it came over the Gulf of Mexico; rather, it was category 5 over the ocean and was downgraded to category 3 when it made a landfall\r\n\r\nThis is false, as anyone who was watching the TV broadcasts in the days leading up to landfall could tell you.

I'm not saying that everybody has to like every cultural characteristic of every person (honestly, do people *really* believe that Muslims have a God-given right to blow up people that don't share their religion?)  But not every stereotypical cultural characteristic applies to every person who physically fits that description.  The vast majority of Muslims do not blow people up; the vast majority of blacks (worldwide; numbers may be different in inner-city America) do not laugh at other peoples' misfortune; the vast majority of East Asians are not math geniuses (though the average East Asian is probably better than the average white American for cultural reasons).", "In defense of Seumas, it can be kinda hard to avoid Joel sometimes.

But there's often no indication of just what you did wrong or how to fix it.\r\n\r\nI spent the first 8 years of my school career learning how to be an asshole, and the next 8 years learning how not to be an asshole.  When you walk onto the bus on the first day of kindergarten and the cool kids are the ones who tease others for being less worldly-wise, the logical conclusion is to tease people.  When you notice that the kid at the bottom of the social hierarchy is the one who gets ostracized at recess, the logical conclusion is to suck up to the popular kids (usually by joining in the ostracization) so you know won't be that kid.  When you get beat up for being the nerdy kid or the artsy kid or anyone who's somehow not in the in crowd, the logical conclusion is that might makes right, and you better be strong and act tough so they don't mess with you.\r\n\r\n&gt; Because then the less experienced members have the ability to learn from the behavior of the more experienced members, as opposed to people having to learn socialization through sheer trial-and-error, perhaps?\r\n\r\nExactly.  I was in an elementary school with mixed 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th grades, a middle school that was strictly age-segregated, and a high school that abolished grades entirely (so you often didn't even know who was a year or two older) and had extensive cross-age connections across all 6 years.  There was a direct correlation between the social health of the school and the number of cross-linkages.\r\n\r\nThings that seem cool when you're 12 or 13, like calling people \"gay\" or \"retarded\", aren't so cool when you're 17.

Eventually I gently told him \"Y'know, when you get a couple years older, you'll find that it's really not cool to call people gay.\"  He made a face and protested weakly, and I didn't press the issue.  But he stopped.  Never heard him say it again.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is why the homeschoolers I know have always been the nicest, most well-adjusted people I've met.

The school situations there were at least as unpleasant as those today.\r\n\r\nAgain, I may be overly romanticizing things; I wasn't alive back then.  But my impression of prairie schooling was that kids could be vicious jackasses to each other, but you were never *trapped* in the same room with people you hate, and people could generally learn from their mistakes and make nice after.  So there were cruel moments, but not the kind of soul-crushing harassment that goes on in junior high schools today.", "&gt; If not then you'll be finding yourself having to borrow another 6000 each time one fails and you try another.

Correct me if I'm wrong on that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think that's a pretty poor example, because most economists *don't* support straight redistributive policies.  At the very least, you'll find a lot of debate on this point.  Many that *do* support redistributive government policies support them for social justice reasons, and not for any economic rationale.  The general belief seems to be that the economic stimulus from a free, unprotected economy outweighs the increased marginal utility of moving dollars to poor people.\r\n\r\nSome better examples:\r\n\r\n* Economists don't believe that monopolies are \"largely the result of government intervention\".  They happen when industries gain significant benefit from employing capital, and hence benefit from economies of scale.  In this industry structure (common to many, many industries nowadays), two companies that merge will find their costs reduced relative to their competitors, thus forcing their competitors to merge or go out of business.  The government needs to take a role in breaking up or regulating these monopolies to preserve competition.\r\n* Economists recognize the existence of transaction costs.  This is why a privatized highway system will not work: the time and monetary costs of collecting small payments every time someone switches from one road owner to another will destroy the road owner's profits and eliminate the consumers' benefits to using the highway, meaning that nobody will end up providing or using the service in the end.  (Advanced technology may change this, but you'd still have to build tollbooths at every ownership change at huge capital expense, and you still have to slow down to about 20 mph to use an electronic toll.)\r\n* Economists recognize the importance of free information to economic exchange.  This is why we have the SEC and various consumer protection agencies.  Without these, consumers &amp; investors have less trust in the goods they're receiving, and so are more likely to say \"forget about that trade\" anyway.\r\n* Economists know what an externality is, like pollution.  They also know that it can be difficult to determine responsibility for who caused an externality, which is why strict liability won't work.  (Though it's an intriguing idea that I'd like to see researched further.)\r\n* Economists know that all things being equal, people prefer to hold liquid currency, because they can do more things with it.  Economic growth depends on tying up liquid funds in capital expenditures, however, which a business will only do if it expects to gain more in future income than it loses in flexibility.  This is why governments inflate the currency, creating a carrying cost that provides an incentive to invest the funds in income-producing investments.  It's also why governments engage in public debt or redistributive taxation, taking money out of the hands of those who have everything they need and putting it into the hands of those who will spend it on the products that entrepeneurs produce.  (This is Keynesianism in a nutshell.)\r\n* Economists also know that currency exchange entails transaction costs, which is why Libertarian \"use any currency\" ideas are a net economic loss.  There's a reason why the EU is moving to the euro, or why the U.S. switched from independent state currencies to the dollar when the Constitution was signed.", "&gt; Put another way, he would have to invest on margin or in options to do the same thing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWell yes, but a mortgage still has similar downsides to a margin loan.  The advantages of a mortage are:\r\n\r\n* Interest is tax-deductible\r\n* I think interest rates are somewhat lower, though it's not a huge difference\r\n* You can get much higher leverage with a mortgage.  Some lenders now offer loans with only a 3-5% down (which is *insane*, IMHO, but I'm not the one risking the money...) while a margin loan requires that the value of your account be enough to cover the loan (i.e. no more than 50% or so).\r\n* If you can't pay back a margin loan, you lose your stocks, while if you can't pay the mortgage you lose your home.  Oh wait, that's not really an advantage.\r\n\r\nWhile real estate has been *historically* less volatile than stocks, I don't think that's the case now, at least in \"hot\" real estate markets.

Sorry, but that isn't a logical argument. He is positing that lisp is great because other things that are great (in his opinion) also aren't popular. So if Jane Austen isn't popular, and Jane Austen is great, therefore lisp must be great too because it isn't popular either. What? That really doesn't follow.\r\n\r\nNo, he's saying that greatness does not equate to popularity, and using Jane Austin as an example. You seemed to completely miss his actual argument:\r\n\r\n&gt;Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard. Its syntax, or lack of syntax, makes it look completely unlike the languages most people are used to. Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid of it too. I recently came across a notebook from 1983 in which I'd written:\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign. \r\nFortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning new things. I was so ignorant that learning almost anything meant learning new things.\r\n\r\n&gt;People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it. The standard excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp was too slow. Now that Lisp dialects are among the faster languages available, that excuse has gone away. Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages are more popular.\r\n\r\n%\r\n\r\n&gt;He also makes the argument that since all programming languages are not equivalent in power, therefore (here's the leap) lisp is better because you can do these neat tricks like macros and lambda. I don't see the leap. Just because you can demonstrate not all languages are equivalent, doesn't necessarily prove that your language is \"better\".\r\n\r\nIt's not so much an objective thing as a collectively subjective thing. Lisp is the only X for which you don't hear people saying \"X is neat and all, but it can't do Y\". (Well, except COBOL. Nobody says COBOL is neat at all.)

Though I don\u2019t have \u201chard data\u201d on whether customer expectations are rising at the same rate as costs are declining, I\u2019m going to make the easily defensible argument that the trend in terms of what you have to give customers is certainly going up.\r\n\r\nActually, you just have to say you'll give it if necessary.

If that's really the case, then I can't say I understand that view, but whatever.\r\n\r\n&gt;Try a Google for something like \"lisp sucks\" and see what comes up.\r\n\r\nLet's see: the first hit is a (short) article which praises Lisp. The phrase comes from one of the comments, which basically says \"common lisp looks difficult and is big and I don't like the syntax, therefore it sucks\". Criticising a single dialect, with bad points. Wow.\r\n\r\nThe second is basically a linkjack of the article \"How Common Lisp Sucks\". Again, a specific dialect. And it was written by a fan, not in order to discourage people from using it but in order to try to facilitate improvement.\r\n\r\nThe third one is nothing more than \"LISP sucks because it never gained market share.\" Oh, and \"VB6 sucks worse.\"\r\n\r\n&gt;if that were the case then there would be many more college graduates who would be lisp advocates. \r\n\r\nFrom what I hear, college graduates generally learn Java, not Lisp.

Joking aside, I think there's a factor of diminishing returns in introspection where the act provides no benefit to the thinker. It's crucial that, as you suggest, people be aware of why they do things, if the things they do are consistent with their stated and implicit goals, and how these decisions affect others. But as those questions get answered (and indeed, new questions arisen to be answered), the questions get fewer and less important. Eventually you end up wondering precisely these things - \"should I focus all my efforts on being great at one thing, or be a master of many trades? Would pursuing the first course make me a specialist ad absurdium, or the latter, a dilettante?\" And the answer is as elusive as searching for the answer to \"is there a God?\" At least religious people know enough to avoid the question and take it on faith.\r\n\r\nI think too much introspection can be damaging, in lost opportunities to experience new things, make mistakes and learn from them, i.e. all the things that really do teach us about ourselves and the world. There's a saying in the Hagakure that \"one should make his decisions in the space of seven breaths\". Regardless of whether that's particularly enough time to decide certain things, the emphasis on making decisions after a limited amount of deliberations is very important. Often you don't have the evidence at the outset to tell you whether a particular choice is a good idea; you need to begin to make progress down the road to find out whether your choice was right.
