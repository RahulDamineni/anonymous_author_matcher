It seems like if the story is about the US government in any way someone is going to post \"the US government masterminded it!!!\" and frankly it's old.  The more likely truth is more boring and people don't like it.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  I've seen NO proof.  Sure the bush administration pushed bad CIA data, sure they leaked the CIA agents name and probably a few other things. But to say that they masterminded 911 or put together a fictitious Zarqawi fellow is just not very productive.  \r\n\r\nSecondly it\u2019s all inflammatory and negative without being productive at all.  So what should we do curl up in a ball and die lonely and scared or overthrow our current government so goldenbb can have a try at it?  Both of these option seem to me to be ridiculous.  The truth is we can do things to help end some of the corruption in congress and the presidency but it takes time and people voting based on the issue of integrity.\r\n\r\nThirdly for the most part the media and the administration hasn\u2019t focused on a single person.  If they were it\u2019d be Osama and not Zarqawi.  When was the last time the Bush Administration said \u201call we have to do is kill Zarqawi and it\u2019s over\u201d.  Most of the media I see hardly mentions Zarqawi anymore except in saying he is the likely leader of al qaeda in Iraq.  Which from the best info we have he is.  That could be totally false but that\u2019s the best guess currently.  In any conflict you are going to talk about the leader of each side.

There are lots of jobs out there for skilled workers, however there just isn't enough training and opportunity for poor families to take advantage of them.  \r\n\r\nAlso I don't think you would see that much inflation.  Business would fire anyone they thought couldn't make them more than $20 an hour.  The reason that small increases in the minimum wage don't hurt employment levels is that most of the people earning minimum wage have high house hold incomes, so if they lost the job they wouldn't be looking for another, and not be counted as unemployed.  Also business usually gets more out of their minimum wage employees than the let the employees know.  They would keep the employees on for a few more dollars but a large raise and they would get fired.   \r\n\r\nThe real problem with raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour is that most unskilled workers would be unable to find employment.

If offshoring and outsourcing really was the panacia you think it is why would so many car manufactures make cars here?  Why is software developed here at all?  Just because someone can do your job for less doesn't mean it makes sense for a company to offshore that labor.  \r\n\r\nBTW, lots of jobs can't be offshored.

Just about every skilled worker is going to be able to do the job he is skilled at quicker and more efficiently than someone that is not skilled.  Some jobs are rendered impossible done by unskilled workers.  You can\u2019t provide medical care with out medical knowledge.

It\u2019s also ridiculous to think that those efficiency gains shouldn\u2019t benefit the people that make it happen.

If there really were a limited number of jobs we would all be unemployed.  So far all you've been able to show is that there might be a link between stagnent wages and outsourcing, but from what I've read it's really hard to make that link.  Fundamentally it makes sense to outsource if possible since other jobs will be available to the workers here and they will be able to buy cheaper goods and services with the money they do make.  Your doom and gloom of everyone out of work doesn't hold water people thought that when we moved away from everyone doing agriculture, same thing when we moved away from manufacturing.  History is on my side, untill you can demonstrate a rising enemployment rate and falling wages due directly to outsourcing you really don't have an arguement.", "\"My question is what makes any job low-wage in the first place.\"  It has everything to do with skill availability.  If everyone in the country was skilled in auto repair the wages of auto mechanics would go down.  So you are right on that count, it's not just skills.  Jobs are low-wage if everyone can do them, so I guess your argument is that if everyone in India (or what ever country) has the same skill set wouldn't that drive down labor costs for everyone with those skills.  It does, that's why people need to develop skills that aren't readily outsourced.  \r\n \r\nTake your dig at CEOs, if it's so easy why aren\u2019t you one?  Why do they make so much money if they are so unskilled?  The reason is that very few people have the skills needed to be a CEO.  If they did we would have a lot more companies in America looking for a lot more workers driving up the cost of labor and dropping the cost of CEOs. \r\n\r\nI can see your response now, \u201cBut all jobs can be outsourced!\u201d they can\u2019t, if they could they would\u2019ve.

People back then said the same thing.  \"There won't be any jobs left, humans won't be needed for anything, machines will do it all\" it didn't come to pass instead people had to learn new skills and apply that skill to other tasks.  Think of outsourcing as just another efficiency gain because it is.  There isn't any difference between creating a call center in India and making a computer program do the exact same thing (assuming we could).", "It's a efficiency gain in terms of of the company doing the outsourcing.  Where as before it cost them $2 million it now only costs 1.75 million. \r\n\r\nBasically if your arguement that outsourcing drives down the cost of certain IT and results in less IT jobs in the US I would be hard pressed to dissagree.  My arguement is that we don't help ourselves by being protectionist.  If we stop outsourcing and immigration we are doomed to be 2nd best as the world speeds ahead of us.  We have to embrace globalisation so that all nations can rise up.  People need to look to thier own competitive advantages and specialize.  Is it going to be easy? NO.

I'm against that kind of stuff to, and this stuff is banned both in china and India.  I'll have to look but I think companies here can be partly liable for damages caused by partners over seas.  The real problem is enforcement, we even have problems in this country with enforcement.  You can't really blame trade for this, these problems have to be dealt with localy or they will never be fixed.  The best you can do is put international pressure on them and not by products that you feel aren't made enviromentally friendly.  Banning imports/exports just puts off the problem to when they do again start creating those products."]}]
